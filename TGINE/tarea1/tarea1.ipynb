Its hands, feet, and tail are dark green and spiky, similar to the foliage of an evergreen tree. On its back are four green spikes that resemble pinecones. Abomasnow lives in snowy mountains and appears only when snow flowers bloom. Once the flowers die, it retreats to isolated areas because Abomasnow prefers to be alone and not associate with others.

As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, a sleeping Abomasnow can still cause blizzards by occasionally swinging its arms. Researchers acknowledged that it is unknown why Abomasnow does this, though it is theorized that it is either a habit to hide itself or just sleepy flailing.

In Galar, packs of its natural predator, Galarian Darumaka, enjoy eating the Berries produced by Snover. This results in Abomasnow often chasing them away in order to protect it. Snover lives on snowy peaks in warm seasons but migrates lower as the weather cools. A curious Pokémon, it often approaches people and can be found inspecting footprints in the snow. There are stories of Snover visiting human settlements, often bonding with the children there. Snover can sink its feet into the snow to absorb water, this helps cool down its body temperature.

Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw. Weavile is distantly related to Sneasler from the Hisui region. Weavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from Sneasel. A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix, and even larger species like Mamoswine, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Weavile has been observed gesturing in its sleep, possibly trying challenging someone in its dreams.

Two of the stripes start jaggedly above Sunkern's dark eyes and continue downward. The other stripe is directly below Sunkern's mouth. Since Sunkern's eyelids are brown, the brown streak patterning appears uninterrupted when Sunkern's eyes are closed. Its beady eyes are black with white pupils. Sunkern is known to be very weak. Aware of its weakness, it only feeds until it evolves. However, it feeds on only the dew from under the leaves of plants. It tries to move as little as possible since it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for evolution. If attacked by predators such as Spearow, it shakes its leaves at the attacker. Sunkern occasionally falls from the sky on early mornings for unknown reasons. A year after a cold summer, the population of Sunkern explodes. Sunkern can be found in temperate, grassy meadows.\"\n",

However, the tail will begin to droop when Snivy loses energy. Snivy can use its vines with incredible adaptive and dexterity skills, to make up for having short arms. This Pokémon has a calm, collected demeanor and is very intelligent. Snivy prefers to be alone and avoid groups whenever it can.

It, especially in its Normal Form, may also be based on the Galápagos tortoise; in particular, it may be inspired by Lonesome George, the last Pinta Island Tortoise (a subspecies of Galápagos tortoise), as Terapagos is said to be extinct aside from a lone male survivor.\",\n",
      "    \"description\": \"In its Normal Form, Terapagos is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. Lastly, it has a \\\"ponytail\\\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them. Normal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokémon, for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel.[1] It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form around itself a green shield when necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, Terapagos causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even as it slumbers, which gave Area Zero its distinctive appearance. As depicted in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, like other turtles, it is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell. Terapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of the them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day.[2] According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Heath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name.[3] With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with countless star-shaped projectiles. Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the core series games and animated series. It is capable of bringing humans, certain Pokémon, and objects forward from other points in time[4] or from alernate timelines altogether.[5] While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As revealed in the Pokémon Horizons episode The Plan to Capture Rayquaza, Terapagos has the ability to call out to other Pokémon with a specific energy signal. As seen in several Pokémon Horizons episodes, Terapagos also has the ability to create visions of the past through the use of its own memories. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI duplicate, and the \\\"time machine\\\" to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokémon without the need to recharge.[6] Terapagos also has a strong connection to the Stellar type.[7] Terapagos is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm. Its Normal Form is also the only known Pokémon that can have Tera Shift as its Ability.\"\n",

The milk that it produces is sweet and very nutritious, and can be used to heal Pokémon and ill or weary humans. Drinking a large amount of Miltank's milk will cause the Pokémon or person to gain weight and develop stomach pains. The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season. It can produce over five gallons of milk per day, which in turn can be turned into yogurt or enjoyed unchanged by children and adults alike. Miltank can become ill if it is not milked every day. Miltank lives in grasslands, and is also raised on farms. Miltank has been supporting the lives of people and other Pokémon since ancient times with its ability to produce milk.\"\n",

The three are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes that once protected the land from the \\\"evil ogre\\\",[1] and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried.[2] According to locals, worshipping Fezandipiti leads to both good luck and serendipitous fortune. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Fezandipiti has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, Fezandipiti can become a Titanic Pokémon. In myth, it is said that Fezandipiti was once a Pokémon with short, dull feathers. A wish to be beautiful led it to meet the Mythical Pokémon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform Fezandipiti. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its waist, chaining Fezandipiti to Pecharunt's will.[3] Fezandipiti transformed, enhancing its capabilities and giving it a stunning appearance and a lovely voice.

It has five black fingers on each hand, which extend from the ends of the fragments forming its arms. It has a single purple eye located in the same spot as the painting's eye. Runerigus seems to be distantly related to Cofagrigus. Runerigus was formed from a painting imbued with an ancient curse, which was activated by absorbing the spirit of a Yamask and brought the painting to life.

It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks. Cursola's overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky.

Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night. Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion.

Hanging from Bombirdier's chest is a long white apron made of its own shed feathers, which droops down past its legs. When flying, Bombirdier holds the end of this apron in its beak. It uses the apron to gather food, such as Basculin, and bring them to its nest. Bombirdier also gathers various objects such as rocks in its apron, which it then drops from high places for fun. It particularly enjoys dropping objects that cause loud noises. A giant Bombirdier, known as the Open Sky Titan, is one of the Titan Pokémon found in Paldea. It mainly resides near a mountain in West Province (Area One) where it feeds on Bitter Herba Mystica inside a hidden cave. Bombirdier is the only known Pokémon that can have Rocky Payload as its Ability.\"\n",

Its face has a jagged mouth and two large tusks that curl inward. Its dark purple ears are long, thin, and serrated, with red on the inside. Great Tusk has a savage nature. The Scarlet Book, which named the creature, describes how it attacked the Area Zero Expedition team with its large body and tusks, fatally injuring one of the explorers in the process.[1] An article from a September issue of Occulture magazine describes Great Tusk as a mysterious life-form resembling Donphan, albeit one with gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an aggressive disposition. Unlike its present-day and future relatives, Great Tusk is never seen curling up into a ball, perhaps prevented by its enormous tusks. There is an unproven theory that the Great Tusk is a living relic of the dinosaur era. Great Tusk was the first Paradox Pokémon to be discovered 200 years ago in Area Zero by the Area Zero Expedition team and recorded by Heath in his Scarlet Book. According to AI Sada, Great Tusk is an ancient Pokémon related to Donphan. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Great Tusk is a counterpart of Donphan from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Great Tusk were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. At some point, one individual escaped Area Zero and consumed Herba Mystica. This Great Tusk became the Quaking Earth Titan, one of the Titan Pokémon found in Paldea. It mainly resides near a hidden cave in Asado Desert where it feeds on Sour Herba Mystica.\"\n",

Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral.

However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand. Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike. Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting. However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing. Muk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities, where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction. Prior to Generation IV, Muk and its pre-evolved form, Grimer, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stench as an Ability.\"\n",

Golurk and Golett's presence in Unova, being based on creatures from Jewish folklore, may also be inspired by the fact that New York City has the highest Jewish population of any city in the world.\",\n",

It has a small head compared to its body, and pale yellow eyes, one of which turns to its left at the bottom, unlike Golett's eye, which turns right. There is a crack across the chest of the armor, which is patched diagonally with a brown seal resembling a belt. It has a crystal-like formation on each shoulder, and there are large bangles on its wrists and ankles. It has a Roman armor-like \\\"skirt\\\" and flat feet beneath. There is an unproven theory that Golurk contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy. Despite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond, the animated series, and the Pokémon Adventures manga. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes Golurk to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging Golurk can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble. Golurk is said to have been invented by ancient people to serve as a laborer and protector of people and Pokémon. It also served as sentries on artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles, where it could fire energy beams. Golurk will faithfully follow its master's orders without question.\"\n",

Square patches of salt dot the entirety of Garganacl's body. Garganacl's salt is rich in minerals and known to have medicinal properties. Garganacl will scrape its fingertips together to share its salt with injured Pokémon, which can heal them quickly. Many Pokémon gather around Garganacl in hopes to lick up its salt.

Most of its skin is bluish-green, but the lower half of its face and the underside of its neck is a pale green. There are three spots on each of its sides that are also light green. It has pink eyes with rounded, yellow eyebrows, short whiskers resembling a mustache, floppy ears, and a small, white beard with a circular extension. On top of its head is a mop of white hair split into four rounded sections: two draped down either side of its head. Fluffy white fur drapes the lower half of its body and conceals its arms when they are tucked against its chest. When its arms are spread, two short claws are revealed on each hand. It has a bushy white tail with a small, curved spike at the base. This draconic Pokémon lives alone in the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level. The Berries it feeds on do not grow at this altitude, so it descends to the base of the mountains daily at dawn. It loves communicating with people and Pokémon, and is especially gentle with children. It will often appear in areas where children gather and play with them. Despite its gentle nature, it becomes enraged if a child it cares for is hurt, and can go as far as to burn the bully's house down if able.[1] As seen in the anime, Drampa is capable of flying. Prior to Generation VIII, Drampa was the only known Pokémon that could have Berserk as an Ability.\"\n",

Its eyes have pink irises and wisps emanating from its white pupils. A plate with three pink indentations on its center covers its face. Instead of hands, Ceruledge wields purple-cyan blades created from both fire and ghost energy—specifically, the lingering regrets of the fallen. These blades can grow into great swords in battle, increasing Ceruledge's power in the process.[1] Almost all of Ceruledge's body is covered in an old set of purple and blue armor. Ceruledge is merciless and will do anything to win a battle. It prefers to do close-quarters combat, with a mix of sneak and surprise attacks. By using its quick speed to locate a foe's blind spots, it will then move closer before slashing them with its large swords. Any cuts from Ceruledge's swords will cause wounds that leak life energy, which the swords then absorb.[1] It can focus its bitter feelings into a slashing attack. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode HZ065, the blades can emit heat even when retracted. Ceruledge is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Bitter Blade.\"\n",

Salandit is found around volcanoes or arid, rocky environments. From the marking at the base of its tail, it can emit both toxic gas and flames. The gas is created by burning body fluids and has a sweet odor that causes dizziness. However, Bug Pokémon are attracted to the scent and are common prey. The female can also release pheromones that attract males of all species, including humans.[1] Additionally, these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by this Pokémon's will. Because of this, male Salandit offers its food to females, leaving it malnourished and unable to evolve.

This Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokémon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest.[1] This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.

      "    \"description\": \"Zarude is a simian Pokémon resembling a baboon or mandrill. Its body is primarily covered in coarse black fur, though its chest and belly are patterned with shorter gray fur. Its upper snout, palms, and rings around its eyes are devoid of fur, and its skin is a light gray. The fur around the side of its head angles into wing-like crests on either side of its eyes. The eyes themselves have red sclerae, green irises, and black, slitted pupils. Its teeth are pointed and its canines are visible when its mouth is closed. Zarude can extend prehensile vines from its wrists, neck, and the soles of its feet at will. It uses these strong and flexible vines to attack, swing from trees, and collect food from a distance. Zarude's vines can also rapidly heal wounds when wrapped around them, and absorb energy from trees.[1] While resting, only the tips of the vines at Zarude's neck and feet extend beyond its skin. However, the vines extending from Zarude's wrists are typically wrapped around its forearms in four concentric rings. Occasionally, Zarude's vines tear off and become nutrients for the soil of the forests it lives in. As shown in Secrets of the Jungle, the number of vines can vary, and may indicate a Zarude's age or importance, with Zarude possessing the most vines being the oldest or most dominant. Zarude are social and live in troops. They're usually incredibly aggressive, and frighten most other Pokémon. They attack anyone that aren't part of their pack; they excel in battle with their sharp claws and quick wit.[1] Zarude is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Jungle Healing.\"\n",

According to official concept arts, Meltan's liquid body is made of gallium, and it can cry gallium tears. Its arms can stretch to be longer or shorter.[1] Meltan is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with Alolan Diglett and Klefki as the shortest Steel-type Pokémon. Meltan's body can corrode various metals, which it feeds on by absorbing them. The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye.[2] According to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts in the same place the Mystery Box, was found. The Mystery Box was created by Melmetal's followers to store away the Meltan created after its death, until one day, they could create a new Melmetal. At the end of a Melmetal's life span, it'll rust and fall apart, however its shards will eventually be reborn as Meltan. It is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the rest of the group to evolve. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Show Me the Metal!, the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs.

Zeraora was born from an explosion caused by a bolt of lightning striking an erupting volcano. It lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokémon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity.[1] Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws.

In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place. When its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes. Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories.[1] While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as Rayquaza.

According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness.[1] Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately. Kommo-o also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, Kommo-o will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in.[2] While the animated series shows that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking. A special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon.

Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pokémon Adventures also elaborates upon Nihilego's neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that Nihilego mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety. Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura[2]. As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown!, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people. Nihilego is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this \\\"merged\\\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple. The toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!, its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows that Nihilego can take full control of the fusion and form an orb with its own mass to prevent its host from escaping the fusion. \"\n",

Each shoulder has a long gray spike and each hand has three pinkish-purple claws. Running down each side of its neck is a dark purple stripe, which connects and forms a loop on its chest. The lower area of the loop is fuchsia and has a short, downward extension in the middle. At the end of its long neck is its head, which has a long, spiked crest on the top. On the sides of its mouth are a pair of curved, gray spikes that act as mandibles. Its glowing cyan eyes are conjoined, rimmed with fuchsia, and have a spiky crest on either side, which gives them a visor-like appearance. A pair of light purple wings sprout from the center of its back. These wings have a single fuchsia claw at the joint, two spikes along the wing-arm and darker purple membranes with fuchsia markings near the spikes. Naganadel originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space in the core series games. However, Naganadel originates from an unnamed world in the animated series. The lower half of Naganadel's body houses its brain. It resembles a swollen wasp's abdomen and is filled with poisonous liquid. It is covered in stripes of light and dark purple and has three hollow stingers at the tip. The stingers are gray and have a fuchsia marking around them. The largest stinger is in the center; the other two are considerably smaller and sit on either side. These stingers are connected to its brain, so it will react violently if they are touched. Its main stinger can eject a luminescent, adhesive poison over a distance greater than six miles.[1] Like all Ultra Beasts, Naganadel stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura[2]. In The Prism Between Light and Darkness!, Naganadel is shown to be able to communicate with humans through telepathy and show them visions of the past.

If Applin runs out of apples to eat or if it is separated from its apple, its body will lose moisture, and it will become dehydrated and weak.[1] Since Applin hides inside an apple, it is sometimes mistaken by the frugivorous Noibat for food.

Conceptually, it may be based on various legends of ghost ships, such as the Flying Dutchman, a ghost ship cursed to eternally sail the seas. Dhelmise's behaviour may be a reference to two famous captains in classic literature: Captain Ahab, the main protagonist in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick that dies tied to his own harpoon while trying to kill a whale; and the captain of the ghost ship Demeter, that in Bram Stoker's Dracula is found tied to the helm of the ship after being drained by the protagonist.\",\n",
      "    \"description\": \"Dhelmise is a Pokémon made up of an anchor and a ship's wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is Dhelmise's true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor's thin shank and the spindle of the wheel. Five individual strands of seaweed trail off this small hub in a star shape. The ship's wheel is lavender on the outside with a yellow inner rim. It is affixed to the back of the spindle by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four handles, all of which are yellow. There are two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a yellow ring-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical ring on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it. Dhelmise prefers large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord. The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow. The victim is then enveloped in seaweed, which can be stretched hundreds of yards, and has its life force drained. In addition to hunting, this Pokémon maintains itself by adding new detritus and seaweed to its body. It is known to get along well with Skrelp and Dragalge. Dhelmise is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Anchor Shot. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Steelworker as an Ability.\"\n",

However should this process get interrupted, Helioptile will be stressed to the point of weakness. As seen in one of its attack animations in the games, its head and frills glow with a pale yellow light when it uses certain moves.

There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type. An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans,  Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper.

Its eyelids are dark purple with long, light blue eyelashes. Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center. This Pokémon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious.[1] Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents. When emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokémon from gathering.[1] Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly. Bruxish is the only known Pokémon that can have Dazzling as an Ability. In Generation VII, Psychic Fangs was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

Kecleon is able to change the colors of its body at will and is known for frequently using this ability to camouflage itself. However, it is unable to change the color of its red stripe. Its color also changes based on its mood and health, darkening in color with better health. By using camouflage to appear almost invisible, it can sneak up on prey and ensnare it with its long pink tongue. If unnoticed for too long, though, it pouts and may never reveal itself. This Pokémon lives in tropical and temperate forests. Although Kecleon typically appears as green with yellow stripes, it is known to possess various non-Shiny color variations. A purplish variant of Kecleon appeared in the Pokémon the Series episode The Kecleon Caper, as a TCG card, and in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series; the purplish Kecleon in the latter also has light-green outlines rather than yellow. Blue, red, and brown variants of Kecleon have made a singular appearance in the TCG. Whether these variants are an example of it changing color or if they are different kinds of Kecleon is unclear.

Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6 °F (2 °C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area. Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signels. In An Unexpected Picnic!, a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pokémon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.[1] It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.\"\n",

Its legs are very strong, to the point that it can carry heavy rocks for a long time, even through the arid lands where it resides. Due to this environment, a Crustle will not come out of its shell if it is a rainy day. It fights members of its species over territory in battles which can become very vicious. If its shell breaks during such a fight, it loses. When Crustle's shell breaks, it will become weaker and unsure of itself.

When hunting, the Pawniard allow the leader Bisharp to perform the finishing blow. Once a Bisharp's head blade is chipped or damaged, it retires from its position as boss. Bisharp keeps a close eye on members of its pack to ensure none of the Pawniard think about betraying it, and absorbs defeated packs into its own tribe during territorial disputes. The Bisharp tribes are in turn spearheaded by Kingambit, which has been known to lead gangs of Bisharp into battle.[1] It is said that only the most outstanding members of the Bisharp tribes can evolve into Kingambit.

Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area. Similar to other Pokémon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth. Unlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected. Prior to Generation V, Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability.\"\n",

Its Gulp Missile Ability may also draw inspiration from cormorant fishing, an ancient fishing technique that consists of using trained cormorants to fish and spit the fish up. Cormorants also frequently hold their wings outstretched, as Cramorant does, to dry their feathers after a dive. The plumage on its neck may be inspired by bibs. Its Shiny variant's orange coloration may be inspired by multiple news stories from the UK involving seagulls having turned orange due to accidentally falling into curry sauce.[2][3][4]\",\n",

It has a ruff of feathers on its head, with the largest clump pointing backward and being surrounded by small singular feathers. Its feet are black, webbed, and have three toes. Its wings seem to be perpetually spread outwards on its sides. Its tail feathers appear asymmetrical, with a slit between them on one side. Cramorant is a gluttonous Pokémon with an instinctive desire to swallow anything whole. It generally hunts for prey along riverbanks. Its preferred prey is Arrokuda, but sometimes it tries to swallow other Pokémon such as Pikachu, attempting to spit them out if it realizes its mistake.[1] As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Cramorant is known to occasionally sleep while still swallowing its prey. The reason for this behavior is unknown to everyone, including the Cramorant itself. Cramorant is quite strong, to the point where it can knock out some opponents in one hit. However, it is also rather unintelligent, forgetful, and bad at learning, as the energy used by its brain is minimal. It tends to focus more on battling, but sometimes it can't remember what it is battling mid-fight. Despite this forgetfulness, Cramorant never forgets Trainers that it trusts. However, it will try to attack its Trainer if they try to steal its food.[1] Cramorant is the only known Pokémon that can have Gulp Missile as its Ability.\"\n",

Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking. Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.[1] Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake.

The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync. Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner.

Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Sappy Ending.

Its wings are small and cannot be used for flying; instead, Archen roost on trees, hop branch to branch, and glide through long distances to snatch prey. Archen is capable of jumping despite being unable to fly. In the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Archeops In The Modern World!, it was shown that Archen does not like Pokémon food but can grow a special plant with its cries. It enjoys the berries grown on this plant. Archen and its evolved form, Archeops, are the only known Pokémon that can have Defeatist as an Ability.\"\n",

It has three pairs of yellow legs, each with a black band around the middle. Spinarak is a nocturnal Pokémon that lives in temperate and tropical forests. It spins webs that are strong enough to withstand having stones set on them and act as nets for fishermen. A patient hunter can wait for days for prey to become ensnared in its web. It senses what kind of prey has been caught by the vibrations in the web and its preferred prey is Cutiefly. Once its prey is captured, a motionless Spinarak will wait until darkness falls. Its poison is not very strong but is potent enough to weaken caught prey. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Hassle in the Castle, silk produced by a Spinarak can be used for facial treatments, as well as patching up skin wounds. Spinarak and its evolved form, Ariados, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Toxic Thread. Before Generation V, Spider Web was its signature move.\"\n",

Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort. Caterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon. It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot. On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva[1].\"\n",

On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for Poltchageist.[1] According to an old tale, Poltchageist was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him.[2] Poltchageist is more active at night than during the day, prowling around towns and their outskirts. By day, Poltchageist dwells in cool, dark places — usually in old houses, which is its favorite.[1] Poltchageist tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for Poltchageist to use as energy.[1] It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once.[2] Another behavior exhibited by Poltchageist is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder.[1][2] Poltchageist and its evolved form, Sinistcha, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability.\"\n",

It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen.

As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail.

As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \\\"divine Pokémon\\\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year.

Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it.

Its enormously long red tongue, coming out of its often closed mouth, which is usually hard to see due to how dark Shellder’s body is, is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey, hence why if Shellder were to close the tongue, nothing could come to it; the tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell. While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its hoist. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell.

Bellibolt's gray belly is covered with a semi-transparent membrane and has a yellow organ inside that resembles a navel, referred to as its belly-button dynamo. As Bellibolt's muscles - especially its well-developed abdominal muscles[1] - expand and contract, this organ generates electricity, which Bellibolt discharges through the bumps on its head. These head bumps glow when discharging electricity, and they also allow Bellibolt to appear more intimidating.[2] Bellibolt is capable of moving very quickly, but usually chooses to act sluggishly.[3] It is difficult to train Bellibolt to initiate a battle because it has an easygoing temperament, and does not notice its opponents until it is attacked. At night, Bellibolt's stomach emits a strange noise, which signals that it is hungry.[2] Bellibolt is seldom found in the wild, but may rarely be seen alongside riverbanks.

In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new.

This Pokémon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere. In battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The Pokémon the Series episode Riddle Me This has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. As stated in the 23rd chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Magmar is very persistent and will hunt down anyone who manages to defeat it. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava. Magmar has a bad habit of unintentionally burning its prey to a crisp. Its body is always constantly burning. Magmar is feared as one of the many causes of fires.\"\n",

During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power.

There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime.

The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pokémon Snap. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps.[1] Very rarely, their sights are Psyduck sleeping peacefully while not holding its head.

When the tide went out, it came up on land to search for prey. However, Cradily cannot move very fast due to its short legs. Instead, Cradily can extend its neck and tentacles by three times its usual length.

There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top. Palossand has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It curses and control people and Pokémon alike, making them gather sand for it to build upon its body. Unlike Sandygast, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the \\\"Beach Nightmare\\\"; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Shivering Shovel Search!, Palossand can manipulate its size to grow to the size of a building and whip up sandstorms with a swing of its tower-like arms. Palossand captures smaller Pokémon into its sandy body by dragging them down into the sand. Once they are trapped, it drains their vitality whenever it pleases, until all there is left under its body are the dried-up bones of its victims, which Palossand is able to fire from the hollows in its arms. The aforementioned Pokémon the Series episode shows that trapped victims are unable to escape Palossand's body unless it has suffered enough damage, otherwise they will be pulled back inside; it also suggests Palossand is not able to drain the life force of humans. Wherever it passes, traces of its victims' ill will are left, which are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.[1] Palossand and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

It has tan legs with feet shaped in a zygodactyl arrangement; i.e. two toes each on the front and back. Each toe is tipped with a yellow claw. Squawkabilly has a rounded, lumpy black crest on its head that resembles a pompadour, and white feathers on its eyelids, face, belly, and the tips of its wings. The rest of its feathers have different colorations depending on the form, which come in green, blue, yellow, and off-white. The feathers around the bottom of its body are notably longer, giving the appearance of a long coat. Squawkabilly are known to be exceptionally noisy. They have a strong sense of community and dislike being alone, so they cooperate and form flocks that can contain more than fifty individuals based on the color of their feathers. In the mornings and evenings, they search for food in forests, towns, and cities; the latter is their preferred habitat, where they fight with other Squawkabilly of different plumes over territory. Green Plumage Squawkabilly make up the largest, most powerful groups, and are viewed by their Blue Plumage counterparts as rivals. Yellow Plumage Squawkabilly are especially fierce, engaging in vicious close combat and driving other bird Pokémon out of towns. White Plumage Squawkabilly have the fewest population numbers, although they are still able to hold territory because their feathers help them camouflage against the white buildings of cities. Squawkabilly once had violent territorial disputes with Fletchling, who inhabit the same rural and urban areas. In Paldea, Squawkabilly is used for the region's Flying Taxi service. Certain Squawkabilly, such as the one found in Medali in the core series games, and Diana's in the animated series, are shown to be capable of mimicking human speech.\"\n",

These special lenses can also detect body heat. Once Inteleon finds a foe's weakness, it will start attacking. This also helps it precisely shoot water from its fingertips at Mach 3. The membrane on its back is extendable and allows it to glide in the air. It also has a sharp knife hidden in its tail. Inteleon is highly intelligent, carefully thinking out strategies before entering combat to ensure a swift and decisive victory.

      "    \"description\": \"Clauncher is a crustacean Pokémon that resembles a bright blue shrimp. It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. One claw forms a single, sharp point; and the other is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail. Clauncher's large claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. Occasionally, its claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea. Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when it was alive. From Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer, are the only known Pokémon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability.\"\n",

A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly.[1] This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas. Despite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, being able to circle the globe in sixteen hours. A kind-hearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in Great Bowls of Fire!, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with Kingdra whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the \\\"sea guardian\\\" and the \\\"Sea Incarnate\\\"; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. Drayden stated in Thrash of the Titans! that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In Fiore, Dragonite used by Pokémon Rangers to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the Dragonite Bus. Dragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea. In fact, An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS categorises the Dragonite family alongside Legendary Pokémon. Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit. In Generation II, Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top. Toxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pokémon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy. Toxapex competes against it in warm ocean currents, despite the odds being against it. Toxapex is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker.

Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot. The West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters. The East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters. Shellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well. This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokémon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before.\"\n",

Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another.

      "    \"origin\": \"Hariyama seems to be based on a sumo wrestler, also known as a rikishi or sumōtori. Its bald head and long hair resemble a chonmage (a traditional hairstyle for sumo wrestlers) before it is tied into a topknot. Its two-toed feet resemble geta or zōri (Japaense wooden sandals). The square flaps surrounding its midsection resemble sagari (stiff strings) that hang off a wrestler's mawashi (cloth belt). Its large hands, category, and ability to learn Arm Thrust may be a reference to harite (an open-hand strike), and its habit of stomping the ground in battle may be a reference to shiko (an exercise/ritual used to drive away spirits).\",\n",
      "    \"description\": \"Hariyama is a large, bulky humanoid Pokémon that is modeled after a sumo wrestler. It has narrow eyes and rounded ears. On its head is a short, triangular crest. Dark blue hair grows across the tops of its eyes, around the head crest, and extends down its back to form a long ponytail. The upper half of its body is cream-colored, while the lower half is dark blue. Yellow extensions encircle its waist, resembling a skirt. There is a small, orange half-circle marking in the center of its torso just above the skirt. Hariyama has large hands with three fingers and small, two-toed feet. Both its hands and feet are orange. Hariyama's body consists mostly of muscle instead of fat. When its body tenses, its muscles become as hard as stone. It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pokémon and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful slapping arms. They are kindhearted and practice etiquette, praising its battle opponents. As it grows older, it focuses more on training Makuhita. It lives in mountainous areas. Iron Hands bear a resemblance to Hariyama. Hariyama and its pre-evolved form, Makuhita, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Smelling Salts by leveling up. Prior to Generation V, Arm Thrust was also one of its signature moves.\"\n",

Its face design appears to be based on a wrestling mask, while the arm around its waist resembles a martial artist's belt. It may also reference octopus wrestling practices popular on the West Coast of the United States during the 1960s, which involved a diver grappling with a large octopus in shallow water and dragging it to the surface. Both Grapploct's normal and Shiny colors may be a reference to blue and white being the most common colors of gi worn by martial artists who practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Additionally, its Shiny variant's red colors may have been inspired by the red belt, the highest-ranking belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\",\n",

It has a dark blue underside and cyan eyes. Four of its eight tentacles act as arms, three act as legs and one is wrapped around its waist. Its mouth is hidden under the bottom flap of its head. With a body made of pure muscle, Grapploct possesses very powerful grip strength. It enjoys fighting opponents, and moves onto the land to fight them before returning to its ocean home. Golisopod is the natural predator or prey of Grapploct, depending on who wins the fight. Grapploct is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Octolock.\"\n",

The Gothic lolita fashion itself is highly influenced by the fashion from the Victorian period of the United Kingdom and also by styles from the Rococo period, the Rococo being an artistic movement born in the 18th century in France, that later spreaded to other parts of Europe and the colonial Americas.\\nConsidering its connection to stars, Gothorita's body shape also slightly resembles the common depiction of the astrological sign Libra, or as a feminine Pokémon it may also represent Virgo, like it does in Horoscope in Unova.\",\n",

Gothorita uses starlight as the source of its power, and is able to use its psychic powers to arrange rocks into the shapes of constellations. It can also use these powers to control people and Pokémon with hypnosis, leading people astray and putting children to sleep before kidnapping them. Because of this, Gothorita is known as the Witch of Punishment. Some people believe Gothorita is from outer space, although this connection is yet to be confirmed.\"\n",

Said shooting abilities, along with its general shape and appearance make it similar to firearms, more specifically, revolvers. Besides the firearm theme, Remoraid and Octillery share the trait that both are based on aquatic animals with suction cups.\",\n",
      "    \"description\": \"Remoraid is a light blue piscine Pokémon with saucer-like eyes and a mouth with four pointed teeth. There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver. It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. For a long period of time, due to their vast anatomical differences, no one believed that Remoraid evolved into Octillery. Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \\\"sniper of the seas.\\\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward. Remoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke, helping it achieve its evolution into Mantine. Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pokémon, travelling downstream from rivers especially when evolution draws near.\"\n",

It may also be inspired by elephant statues often made of copper or bronze, which are common in Indian art and Thai art.\",\n",
      "    \"description\": \"Copperajah is a large, cuboid, elephantine Pokémon with a dark green body and a light teal underbelly. Pokédex entries for its pre-Evolution Cufant suggest that this coloration probably results from the tarnishing of copper in its skin over time. Untarnished copper accents cover most of Copperajah's face, and pattern its ears, feet, trunk, and back. It has short, blunt tusks and a long, broad, muscular trunk that ends in three claw-like protrusions. It has three raised, white ridges on the dorsal end of its trunk, and several rocky protrusions on the dome of its skull. Despite being found in the Galar and Paldea regions, Copperajah and its pre-evolved form Cufant are not native to either of them, having been imported from another region to work with humans. It also works with other Pokémon, such as Gigalith, in construction sites and mines. Copperajah's tarnished skin is resistant to water. It has enough physical strength to pull an airplane, and its trunk is strong enough to crush boulders into powder. It lives in social herds and has a boastful disposition; the more vibrant its skin is, the prouder it will be.\"\n",

On its face, it has small nostrils, half-lidded eyes with green eyelids, a thin line connecting its eyes, and a blue dot next to each eye. On its head are three hairlike structures, two dark blue and one purple. One of the structures sticks up like a cowlick. The other two droop over the face and cover one eye, resembling \\\"emo\\\" bangs. Inside its mouth, Drizzile has a long, mucus-coated tongue that can be used for catching prey or attacking opponents.[1] Like its pre-evolved form, Sobble, it has a chameleon tail that swirls inward. Drizzile uses special pores in its palms to secrete moisture, which it forms into water balloons that it uses to attack. Drizzile is highly intelligent, capable of devising strategies or using its surroundings to enact hit-and-run tactics. However, it is also exceptionally lazy and prefers to not do anything unless it has to. It makes its home inside tree hollows or rocks. It is very cautious, and lays out traps everywhere around its territory to keep enemies out. Like its evolutionary relatives, it also has the ability to camouflage itself when wet.[1] Drizzile typically moves on all fours, although it can stand and walk on two legs. Drizzile will use its long, slimy tongue to first attack its prey with blinding speeds before finishing it off with great skill.\"\n",

Ancient legends once told Cofagrigus could seal nearby humans in their bodies and turn them into mummies; grave robbers who mistake them for normal coffins get this fate. Cofagrigus is said to have once been human but having forgotten its memories from when it was alive. They also enjoy eating gold nuggets. It lives in tombs and ruins waiting for victims. Cofagrigus has been used as a symbol for the wealth of kings from a bygone era.
