Its hands, feet, and tail are dark green and spiky, similar to the foliage of an evergreen tree. On its back are four green spikes that resemble pinecones. Abomasnow lives in snowy mountains and appears only when snow flowers bloom. Once the flowers die, it retreats to isolated areas because Abomasnow prefers to be alone and not associate with others. It is able to create blizzards to hide itself and can also cause whiteout conditions with just a shake of its massive body. Abomasnow is also known as the \\\"Ice Monster\\\" and \\\"abominable snowman\\\". It protects Snover from packs of Galarian Darumaka, who chase them for the Berries they grow, by swinging its arms like hammers. Abomasnow is powerful enough to split huge boulders in two. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, a sleeping Abomasnow can still cause blizzards by occasionally swinging its arms. Researchers acknowledged that it is unknown why Abomasnow does this, though it is theorized that it is either a habit to hide itself or just sleepy flailing. Prior to Generation VI, Abomasnow and its pre-evolved form, Snover, were the only known Pokémon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability.\"\n",

Five cones form its hand: a large central cone with four smaller cones around it. Edible white Berries grow along Snover's midsection. It usually grows the berries when spring approaches. In Galar, packs of its natural predator, Galarian Darumaka, enjoy eating the Berries produced by Snover. This results in Abomasnow often chasing them away in order to protect it. Snover lives on snowy peaks in warm seasons but migrates lower as the weather cools. A curious Pokémon, it often approaches people and can be found inspecting footprints in the snow. There are stories of Snover visiting human settlements, often bonding with the children there. Snover can sink its feet into the snow to absorb water, this helps cool down its body temperature.

Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw. Weavile is distantly related to Sneasler from the Hisui region. Weavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from Sneasel. A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix, and even larger species like Mamoswine, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Weavile has been observed gesturing in its sleep, possibly trying challenging someone in its dreams. It is specalated that Weavile does this as cunning tactic to prevent those around it from figuring out that it's asleep.\"\n",

Foongus uses its Poké Ball-like pattern to lure people and Pokémon in grassy areas, before releasing a cloud of poisonous spores to defend itself. The spores can be used as a stomach medicine if thoroughly dried. Foongus moves by either hopping or turning on its side and rolling on its cap. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon.

When not in use, these vines curl into a detail-less dome shape on the top of the head, which is wrapped around by the green crest. Yellow fur or feather-like fluff from the sides of their face extend to its back and the top of its scalp from which its blue vine stems from. Comfey are usually seen with flowers that are white, purple, red, and yellow in all visual media, however each Comfey wear different flowers. Comfey usually hold the of one of its vine with its two short arms. Comfey is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. This Pokémon stretches sticky vines from its head to pick flowers to create the ring around itself and will give these rings to those it likes. The flowers can also be thrown at enemy Pokémon to create an opening to either flee or attack. However, it feels uneasy without flowers. Comfey spread oil from their body along these flower rings, changing the flowers so that they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pokémon at hospitals and Pokémon Centers.[1] Each Comfey wear different flowers, which give off its own unique scent and never wither. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Comfey is known to sleep with a smile and a flower close to its face.[2] The flower is said to have a scent that helps it sleep comfortably. Comfey is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Floral Healing. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Triage as an Ability.

However, the tail will begin to droop when Snivy loses energy. Snivy can use its vines with incredible adaptive and dexterity skills, to make up for having short arms. This Pokémon has a calm, collected demeanor and is very intelligent. Snivy prefers to be alone and avoid groups whenever it can. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.\"\n",

However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect.

It can infuse both humans and Pokémon with energy and vitality. Because of this, Xerneas is highly respected by the ancient people of Kalos for its role in giving life. Xerneas is also known to be able to speak through telepathy. According to legend, Xerneas is known to have rescued wounded Pokémon during an ancient war. Xerneas and Yveltal have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. Xerneas's power can also be used to power up machines such as the ultimate weapon.

The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare. Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level. Weezing lives in urban areas.

Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases.

Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip.

Lastly, it has a \\\"ponytail\\\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them. Normal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokémon, for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel.[1] It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form around itself a green shield when necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, Terapagos causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even as it slumbers, which gave Area Zero its distinctive appearance. As depicted in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, like other turtles, it is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell. Terapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of the them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day.[2] According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Heath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name.[3] With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with countless star-shaped projectiles. Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the core series games and animated series. It is capable of bringing humans, certain Pokémon, and objects forward from other points in time[4] or from alernate timelines altogether.[5] While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As revealed in the Pokémon Horizons episode The Plan to Capture Rayquaza, Terapagos has the ability to call out to other Pokémon with a specific energy signal. As seen in several Pokémon Horizons episodes, Terapagos also has the ability to create visions of the past through the use of its own memories. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI duplicate, and the \\\"time machine\\\" to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokémon without the need to recharge.[6] Terapagos also has a strong connection to the Stellar type.[7] Terapagos is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm.

Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. While the cloak's sleeves move as if Ogerpon has arms beneath them, it actually has no arms or even shoulders; the cloak itself is prehensile and serves as its arms, with the \\\"sleeves\\\" able to grasp and manipulate objects. Ogerpon can also extend a prehensile branch and vine from its torso. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind one of its masks, and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Ogerpon is a very intelligent Pokémon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pokémon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in Kitakami's Festival of Masks. Usually causing trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the village’s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye.[1] It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, Ogerpon is capable of Terastallizing itself without the need of a Tera Orb, supposedly due to the masks being made of Tera crystals, just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. Ogerpon is mortal enemies with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt, mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past. In Kitakami myths, it is described as \\\"the ogre\\\". Ogerpon is the only known Pokémon capable of using the move Ivy Cudgel. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Embody Aspect as an Ability in any of its Terastallized states.\"\n",

Fezandipiti, together with Okidogi and Munkidori, are known as the Loyal Three, the heroes of Kitakami. The three are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes that once protected the land from the \\\"evil ogre\\\",[1] and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried.[2] According to locals, worshipping Fezandipiti leads to both good luck and serendipitous fortune. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Fezandipiti has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, Fezandipiti can become a Titanic Pokémon. In myth, it is said that Fezandipiti was once a Pokémon with short, dull feathers. A wish to be beautiful led it to meet the Mythical Pokémon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform Fezandipiti. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its waist, chaining Fezandipiti to Pecharunt's will.[3] Fezandipiti transformed, enhancing its capabilities and giving it a stunning appearance and a lovely voice. It possesses powerful pheromones, capable of captivating both humans and Pokémon with a beat of its glossy wings to scatter them through the air.\"\n",

A distinctive feature of Miraidon is the gular sac on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple casque reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. Miraidon's eyes resemble an LED display, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. Miraidon's shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, fender-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of Miraidon's feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling tire treads. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Miraidon is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac. Despite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. Miraidon's calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. Miraidon also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically Herba Mystica sandwiches, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Miraidon can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the advanced engine within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by Electric Terrain. In battle, Miraidon can also race at ultrafast speeds to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with Cyclizar, a contemporary Pokémon, though Miraidon is notably more powerful and aggressive. The origins of Miraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Turo, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. According to AI Turo, it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was referred to as the \\\"Iron Serpent\\\" in the Violet Book, with its current name, Miraidon, attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a bootstrap paradox.

Calyrex is known as the \\\"King of Bountiful Harvests\\\" by Crown Tundra's inhabitants due to its role in bringing lush vegetation and harvests yearly. Calyrex's right hand can cause the land to be covered in verdant grass and blooms, while its left hand allows it to make fields of fruit ripen and become heavy. Calyrex can grow either Iceroot or Shaderoot Carrots, depending on the field where Carrot Seeds are planted on, with a special dance. Calyrex can also create the Radiant Petal needed for the Reins of Unity and with enough energy, even a complete flower. It can provide healings or blessings such as mending the heart.

It is known for having a great affinity for water, being able to live within water with no difficulty at all, as well as dive and surf all around the area. Because of its meek, friendly nature, Goodra is often teased for supposed weakness. Goodra is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. Goodra usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. Goodra can become uncontrollable once enraged. The horns can hit 100 times harder than the blow of a heavyweight boxer. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. Goodra lives in plains and mountains, usually during rainy days. Prior to Generation IX, Goodra and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability.\"\n",

Braviary is extremely aggressive, but for noble reasons. It is known for its bravery and pride, and will fight fiercely to help and protect its friends. Even if it is injured or has its life threatened, it will still fight. The more scars it has on its front, the more respect it gets from its peers. Scars on its back will bring it ridicule, however. It has earned the nickname \\\"the hero of the skies\\\" due to its extreme dedication for its friends. Aiding its valiance, Braviary is extremely strong, capable of lifting a car and flying with it. However, due to its hotheaded and belligerent nature, it was rejected from being the Flying Taxi carrier in Galar in favor of Corviknight.

Its ears are droopy with yellow insides, and they partially cover its eyes. It has a triangular pink snout with two huge oval nostrils as well as stubby feet ending in pink hooves. Its tail is short and curled. Lechonk has an excellent sense of smell, which it uses to find fragrant wild grasses and rich Berries to eat. This diet causes it to emanate a herbal body odor that repels bug Pokémon.[1] Lechonk is also known to feed on the sweet nectar on Appletun's back. Lechonk has a timid and faint-hearted temperament, and will panic and charge forward if attacked or startled by an opponent. Despite its apparent bulk, Lechonk's body mainly consists not of fat but of muscle, built up by its habit of walking around to find food.[1] Some Trainers use Lechonk to look for cooking ingredients, such as detached Crabominable pincers scattered on mountains. As seen in the anime, Lechonk will become hostile towards trainers carrying groceries or meals and attack them for their food.\"\n",

Because of the training Combusken does by running through its grassland habitat, these legs are capable of delivering a barrage of kicks. Its kicks are said to have outstanding destructive power. Combusken can unleash up to 10 kicks per second. While it is fighting, it is noisy and produces sharp cries that distract and intimidate its opponent.

Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers. Rattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on plains and savannas. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Rattata is known to sleep sometimes with a log in its mouth.[1] Prior to Generation IV, Rattata and its evolved form, Raticate, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang.\"\n",

      "    \"descripcion\": \"Vespiquen is a bee-like Pokémon with a typical insect-like, three-part body, i.e. divided into an abdomen, thorax, and head. It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the ‘gown’ part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion. Similar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward. Vespiquen is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order.\"\n",

The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pokémon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Poké Spokesman, it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman, it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again. Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch. In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.[1]There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.\"\n",

It has been shown to eat berries, but when food is scarce it will eat its leafy clothing as an alternative. Sewaddle is a very popular mascot used by fashion designers. Sewaddle tend to greet each by rubbing their bumps together.\"\n",

Just under its crest are its narrow eyes, which have white sclera and pupil and black irises. Angular black markings extend from behind its eyes and continue down its cheeks. It has a short, stubby beak and feet with two toes in front and one in back. Both its beak and feet are a grayish-pink. It has a short, brown tail made of three feathers. Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction and homing instincts. It can travel straight back to its nest regardless of how far away it might have flown. It is a docile Pokémon and prefers to flee from its enemies rather than fight them. Flapping its wings rapidly can whip up dust clouds and create whirlwinds to protect itself and flush out potential prey. Pidgey is common throughout its range and can often be seen in meadows and temperate forests. Ekans and Sneasel are natural predators of Pidgey. In Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, though other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as Rookidee and Hoothoot, would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants. They can also be found near Electric-type Pokémon, as a means of avoiding attacks from bird-like Pokémon.[1] As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Grubbin uses its mandibles to makes nests underground. It has been observed sleeping in the dirt. It is believed that the dirt it sleeps in is possibly fluffy and comfortable.\"\n",

The sturdy shell covering Charjabug's body protects it from attacks, allowing it to eat peacefully. This diet helps Charjabug evolve into Vikavolt. In its body is an electric sac, which it uses to store electricity generated by digesting food. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day and can be shared with other Pokémon.[1] People on camping trips are grateful to have a Charjabug around. It can discharge electricity from the tips of its jaws to attack especially persistent opponents. Charjabug will zap anyone who accidentally steps on it. As shown in the anime, it can send sound waves to communicate with nearby Grubbin. Vikavolt is known to clasp Charjabug in between its legs and use it as a battery to enhance its Electric-type moves, unless it is in an aerial battle. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Charjabug releases electricity while it sleeps. The reason is due it still digesting the meal it consumes.

Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pokémon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way.

Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pokémon Adventures also elaborates upon Nihilego's neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that Nihilego mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety. Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura[2]. As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown!, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people. Nihilego is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this \\\"merged\\\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple. The toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!, its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows that Nihilego can take full control of the fusion and form an orb with its own mass to prevent its host from escaping the fusion. \"\n",

Sandygast is known to inhabit beaches, and is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pokémon that suffer defeat in battle or the deceased. It can suck the life force of people or Pokémon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. Sandygast uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. Sandygast cares a lot about the shovel on its head. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel.[1] Sandygast attacks prey by flinging sand into their eyes; however, because Sandygast is very slow, its prey tend to escape before it can approach them.

Magcargo's back is protected by a gray, spherical shell composed of hardened, but brittle magma, forming irregular lumps and plates. Marcargo can store fire energy in its shell. A streak of fire leaks from the side of its shell. Magcargo's lower body is amorphous and covered in bubbles of magma. Magcargo's internal body temperature can reach over 18,000 °F (10,000 °C), causing it to evaporate water on contact. Flames circulate throughout its body, occasionally spouting through cracks in its shell. While its shell is brittle enough to be shattered with a slight touch, Magcargo can reform its body by dipping itself in magma. It can be found in mountainous regions and has been living in volcano craters for tens of thousands of years. According to one folklore, when the wild Magcargo population suddenly increases, it's a sign that a volcano eruption is coming.\"\n",

When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type. In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place. When its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes. Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories.[1] While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as Rayquaza. Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, Alola being one of them. Minior is the only known Pokémon that can have Shields Down as an Ability.\"\n",

It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top. Palossand has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It curses and control people and Pokémon alike, making them gather sand for it to build upon its body. Unlike Sandygast, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the \\\"Beach Nightmare\\\"; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Shivering Shovel Search!, Palossand can manipulate its size to grow to the size of a building and whip up sandstorms with a swing of its tower-like arms. Palossand captures smaller Pokémon into its sandy body by dragging them down into the sand. Once they are trapped, it drains their vitality whenever it pleases, until all there is left under its body are the dried-up bones of its victims, which Palossand is able to fire from the hollows in its arms. The aforementioned Pokémon the Series episode shows that trapped victims are unable to escape Palossand's body unless it has suffered enough damage, otherwise they will be pulled back inside; it also suggests Palossand is not able to drain the life force of humans. Wherever it passes, traces of its victims' ill will are left, which are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.[1] Palossand and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

It is believed that if Snorunt shows up during the night, they will cause heavy snow to appear in the morning.\"\n",

Ledian sleeps wrapped in leaves or grass in temperate and tropical forests during the day. At night, it flutters around scattering a glowing powder that is thought to bring good luck. It is believed to use starlight as energy and the patterns on its back grow larger or smaller depending on the number of stars in the sky. In addition to starlight, it loves to eat Berries. A weak fighter, it tries for quantity over power by throwing a barrage of punches with all four of its arms.\"\n",

This Pokémon lives in dark forests and competes with Parasect over territory; their fights often leave the area coated in spores. In the Pokémon the Series episode Lulled to La-La Land!, Shiinotic has been shown illuminating the spot and gills on its mushroom. This strange light can confuse people who enter its habitat, causing them to lose their way. Additionally, the flickering spore it releases can cause drowsiness. It takes advantage of sleeping prey by sucking their energy through the tips of its arms. It can also transmit energy to whomever it likes, be it human, Pokémon, or vegetation, through the same method.

Poltchageist is always seen carrying a 茶杓 chashaku, the tea scoop used to transfer tea powder into the tea bowl in the aforementioned tea ceremony. Poltchageist heavily resembles Sinistea, although they are not biologically related. On top of its matcha body, just below its lid, is a yellow swirl pattern similar to the one found on Sinistea. On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for Poltchageist.[1] According to an old tale, Poltchageist was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him.[2] Poltchageist is more active at night than during the day, prowling around towns and their outskirts. By day, Poltchageist dwells in cool, dark places — usually in old houses, which is its favorite.[1] Poltchageist tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for Poltchageist to use as energy.[1] It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once.[2] Another behavior exhibited by Poltchageist is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder.[1][2] Poltchageist and its evolved form, Sinistcha, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability.\"\n",

Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity.[1] Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws.

Pidgeotto's beak and legs are pink. Two of its toes point forward, while one points backward. Additionally, it has powerful, sharp talons that it uses to grasp prey. Pidgeotto is a powerful flier capable of carrying prey several miles to its nest. It has amazing vision, which helps it locate preferred prey Pokémon such as Exeggcute and Magikarp. The Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon depicts it preying on Caterpie. Pidgeotto claims a sprawling territory of more than 60 miles (100 kilometers), which it defends fiercely. Its nest is usually in the center of its territory and it circles its territory throughout the day, looking out for food and intruders. It is most often found in temperate forests. In Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal, and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin.

Bronzong's cry is also believed to have the power to open a hole leading to other worlds. Many scientists believe the Bronzong found in Galar originated from a different region after researching the patterns on its body. Some Bronzong can sleep up to 2,000 years, with one such case leading to quite the media story when one was discovered at a construction site. Bronzong typically lives in ruins and mountain ranges.

Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees. At 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokémon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!, Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave!, it's shown that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger.

It was originally believed to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, though recent research on this claim suggests otherwise. Its wings are small and cannot be used for flying; instead, Archen roost on trees, hop branch to branch, and glide through long distances to snatch prey. Archen is capable of jumping despite being unable to fly. In the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Archeops In The Modern World!, it was shown that Archen does not like Pokémon food but can grow a special plant with its cries. It enjoys the berries grown on this plant. Archen and its evolved form, Archeops, are the only known Pokémon that can have Defeatist as an Ability.\"\n",

Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail. It is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pokémon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils frequently being found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death.\"\n",

Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6 °F (2 °C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area. Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signels. In An Unexpected Picnic!, a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pokémon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.[1] It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.\"\n",

Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse but grow back quickly. Crabrawler's pincers are a popular ingredient for paella, making a tasty soup stock. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.

Three additional spikes protrude from its forehead, and another pair of spikes are visible on either side of its lower body. While its arms and legs are developing inside the shell, Pupitar uses compressed gas to propel itself around, and can generate enough force to knock down mountains. Pupitar even performs this technique even when it sleeps. Pupitar lives and moves freely around harsh mountain ranges. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Pupitar is known to move around even when sleeping.[1]\"\n",

      "    \"descripcion\": \"Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue, coming out of its often closed mouth, which is usually hard to see due to how dark Shellder’s body is, is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey, hence why if Shellder were to close the tongue, nothing could come to it; the tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell. While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its hoist. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder. Prior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pokémon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.\"\n",

It builds its nest on mountains where iron ore is buried, which results in it clashing with humans that are iron mining or other Lairon.

Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections.

The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them. This Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokémon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest.[1] This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.

There is a small, orange half-circle marking in the center of its torso just above the skirt. Hariyama has large hands with three fingers and small, two-toed feet. Both its hands and feet are orange. Hariyama's body consists mostly of muscle instead of fat. When its body tenses, its muscles become as hard as stone. It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pokémon and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful slapping arms. They are kindhearted and practice etiquette, praising its battle opponents. As it grows older, it focuses more on training Makuhita. It lives in mountainous areas. Iron Hands bear a resemblance to Hariyama. Hariyama and its pre-evolved form, Makuhita, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Smelling Salts by leveling up. Prior to Generation V, Arm Thrust was also one of its signature moves.\"\n",

Walrein lives in and around icy seas, where it is insulated against the cold by its thick layer of blubber. This layer of fat also protects it from enemy attacks by causing them to bounce off. While its long tusks are capable of crushing ice up to 10 tons in one blow, they may break during battle. Walrein's tusks grow continuously throughout its life, and any broken ones will grow back by the following year. The Hisui region is famous for the many broken tusks of Walrein that can be found there. This Pokémon can be found in herds of 20 to 30 individuals, which are fiercely protected by the leader. The leader is willing to give up its life in order to protect the herd. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Walrein has been seen sleeping with a tusk stuck in the ground.

Buneary almost always keeps one of its ears rolled up. Although Professor Laventon had hypothesized that this is done to protect its hearing, in actuality, Buneary rolls its ears so it can quickly unroll them and launch them as an attack. The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders and increases in power as Buneary trains to use it. Buneary can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. Buneary's arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If Buneary senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if Buneary rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, Buneary sleeps with its head tucked into its fur.

Bellibolt's gray belly is covered with a semi-transparent membrane and has a yellow organ inside that resembles a navel, referred to as its belly-button dynamo.

These head bumps glow when discharging electricity, and they also allow Bellibolt to appear more intimidating.[2] Bellibolt is capable of moving very quickly, but usually chooses to act sluggishly.[3] It is difficult to train Bellibolt to initiate a battle because it has an easygoing temperament, and does not notice its opponents until it is attacked. At night, Bellibolt's stomach emits a strange noise, which signals that it is hungry.[2] Bellibolt is seldom found in the wild, but may rarely be seen alongside riverbanks.

In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes.

This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame.

They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it.

Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers.

Nidorina is a gentle Pokémon, and it is known to be a caring mother that chews food for its young. It seems to display close family bonds with others of its kind and becomes nervous when separated. Nidorina prefers not to fight since its horn grows slowly, but if forced or enraged, it prefers physical attacks such as clawing and biting. Nidorina prefers to chew its food into a paste before spitting it out and feeding its children. It also emits ultrasonic cries to befuddle foes. Nidorina live in burrows at hot savannas and plains.\"\n",

It is predominantly brownish red with scaly patterns on its skin and scattered orange highlights on some scales and ridges. Tyrantrum's head is proportionately large with a blunt, ridged snout and powerful jaws. It has black around its eyes and a light gray lower jaw covered by a beard of white, primitive feathers. Several sharp teeth are visible in the lower jaw, while the upper jaw is lined with orange-tipped, tooth-like projections. Over its eyes is a row of five spikes resembling a crown. Around Tyrantrum's neck is a feathery white ruff that extends over its shoulders similar to a cape. Its underbelly is gray with white borders and there are two orange spikes near the tip of its long tail. Its small forelimbs have only two black-clawed digits each, but it has powerful hind legs with three black claws each. Plated, armor-like ridges cover its knees, back, and the top of its tail. Before its extinction 100,000,000 years ago, Tyrantrum was known to be vicious but had the presence of a magnificent king. Its powerful jaws, capable of shredding thick metal plates as easily as paper, made it invincible. Its strength allows it to sleep in the wild entirely unguarded without feeling worried. It is theorized that its original form was completely covered with a feather-like coat.\"\n",

A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos, Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in. In its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs. In its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear. Gastrodon and its pre-Evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate. Gastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late.\"\n",

When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well. This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokémon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before.\"\n",

Grafaiai has a moody temperament and is attentive to detail. It is a solitary species, and often gets into territorial fights with other Pokémon, including other Grafaiai. Grafaiai's saliva is brightly colored and poisonous, and its color changes depending on Grafaiai's diet, which includes Berries and Bug-type Pokémon.[1][2] Grafaiai uses this poisonous saliva to attack foes, either by spitting the saliva at them or by coating its hands with the saliva before slashing at them. Should Grafaiai sense danger, its poison becomes more concentrated and can immobilize a victim for about three days once absorbed.[2] Grafaiai is nocturnal. During the night, it licks its hands and fingers with its poisonous saliva, before using them to draw patterns on trees. This not only marks Grafaiai's territory, but it also draws in Bug-type Pokémon with its sweet scent. The poison causes Grafaiai's prey to be immobilized and trapped until Grafaiai goes to collect them at dawn.[2] Each Grafaiai has its own signature pattern, which it will paint over and over throughout its life.

This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs. The legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top. Toxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pokémon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy.

A male Pyroar has a large, predominantly red mane with gold streaks forming a pattern resembling the Daimonji symbol (大) and the symbol for fire (火). In contrast, a female has a long, gold and red crest-like mane extending from its forehead. Female Pyroar significantly outnumber their male counterparts. The female's mane is as long as its whole body, and the light brown on its front legs extends all the way to its shoulders. The light brown fur on the male's front legs only extends up to its elbows. Like real-life lions, Pyroar live in prides, which are led by the male with the largest mane. The pride's females protect the Litleo cubs and teach them how to hunt. The females also work together to bring down prey, ensuring the pride never goes hungry. A male Pyroar is usually lazy, but will protect its friends at the risk of its own well-being. In battle, the male Pyroar's mane can heat up to over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), which can cause severe burns when approached. Pyroar viciously threatens any challenger with a fiery breath exceeding 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). However, it prefers its meat raw and does not use its breath on its prey. Pyroar typically lives in grassy plains and mountainsides. Prior to Generation VII, Pyroar and its pre-evolved form, Litleo, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Noble Roar.\"\n",

Dhelmise prefers large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord. The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow. The victim is then enveloped in seaweed, which can be stretched hundreds of yards, and has its life force drained.

Murkrow awakens at dusk and moves during the night. It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokémon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, \\\"Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come,\\\" would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a Murkrow. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket's ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks (referred to as \\\"murders\\\") amongst forests and swamps.

Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking. Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.[1] Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.\"\n",

Cherrim waits quietly as a bud for a ray of sunlight. When it is hit with strong sunlight, it blooms and absorbs the rays with its entire body. It quickly changes from quiet to excitable and active. It will attempt to make up for everything it was forced to endure as a bud while the sunlight lasts. Once the light is gone, Cherrim folds back into a bud. Bug Pokémon are often seen gathering around Cherrim due to being drawn in by the scent released from its petals. Cherrim is the only known Pokémon that can have Flower Gift as an Ability.\"\n",

In the TCG, a resting Stonjourner is shown to be able to detach and rotate its legs. Occasionally, Stonjourner will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it stands in a field watching the sun's progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, groups of Stonjourner gather from all over to form an evenly spaced ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories involving the position of the sun, the earth's energy, and other factors.[1] Another curiosity is that the elemental composition of the rocks that form Stonjourner's body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from its native habitat.

Below its mouth is a dumbbell-shaped protrusion; together with its abdomen, they create the impression of pectoral and abdominal muscles. Its arms are segmented into three parts. The arm segments grow in size with the smallest being closest to the body. Its claws have a dark blue pawprint-shaped marking on the tips which create Bigfoot prints on snow. The mark that would be the \\\"palm\\\" of the paw is actually the lower half of the claw. Its four legs are short, with pointed tips that are freezing to the touch, as shown in Pokémon Refresh. Its evolution was triggered by exposure to the snowy mountains.[1] Crabominable grew its fluffy fur to combat the icy cold of its mountain home. It can also store cold in its claws, which are capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, Crabominable can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since Crabominable has a slow movement speed. Crabominable's detached pincers are said to have a delicious taste; some Trainers have been known to use Lechonk just to find these pincers.

Ralts prefers to hang out with people of cheerful nature more than those with gloomy natures. Regardless, Ralts will show no discrimination to anyone based on age or gender. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, when you see a Ralts smiling in its sleep, that means something good has happened during that day.[1]\"\n",

It also possesses a purple, flower-like tuft of hair on the end of its thin tail. Delcatty is happy most of the time and rarely gets involved in conflicts. When it is disturbed, it just moves to another area instead of fighting. It prefers to do as it pleases at its own pace, so its daily routine is random. It is popular among female Trainers and used in competitions for its style and sublime fur. It is nocturnal and active at dusk. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Delcatty is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in tropical and temperate forests. It does not have a permanent nest and instead finds comfortable spots to sleep. Delcatty and its pre-evolved form, Skitty, are the only known Pokémon that can have Normalize as an Ability.\"\n",

The shape of the antlers and the black orbs causes them to resemble eyes. Stantler can distort reality and create illusions with its antlers by subtly changing the flow of air around them. Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand. The orbs on the antlers have a pleasant scent, which can induce a bewildering effect on people. The orbs can also be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping. Stantler's strange antlers were very valuable as works of art, and as such, the species was nearly hunted to extinction. Stantler live in herds in temperate, mountainous forests; these herds are sometimes led by a Wyrdeer. As shown in the Pokémon the Series episode The Little Big Horn, a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats. In the past, Stantler lived in tougher environments with more enemies, which strengthened its psychic powers and allowed it to evolve into Wyrdeer.

Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents. When emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokémon from gathering.[1] Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly. Bruxish is the only known Pokémon that can have Dazzling as an Ability. In Generation VII, Psychic Fangs was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp. In Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes.\"\n",

It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges. Kommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray. Kommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pokémon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness.[1] Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately. Kommo-o also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, Kommo-o will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in.[2] While the animated series shows that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking. A special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon. This Kommo-o possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Kommo-o and completing the trial is a Dragonium Z. Kommo-o is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul. Kommo-o is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze.\"\n",

When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral.

Vikavolt produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. Vikavolt shoots these to strike down bird Pokémon.

As shown in the episode A High-Speed Awakening!, it likes to drink tree sap. In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola, there is a competition known as the Vikavolt race, where Trainers can have their Vikavolt race for the chance to win a Buginium Z. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Vikavolt's mobility is exceptional, to the point it can remain flying while it sleeps. This usually happens after intense battles, where Vikavolt used up too much electricity.

Goomy is considered the weakest Dragon-type Pokémon. Its body is mostly water and is covered by a germ-laden mucous membrane. This slimy layer causes physical attacks to slide off harmlessly. However, it becomes unable to breathe and will die if its body dries out. Because of this, it stays in damp, shady areas. Goomy's horns have powerful sensors that allow it to locate any sign of the enemy, allowing it to survive any kind of danger. As seen in the anime, its diet consists of leaves. In Hisui, when Goomy evolves into Sliggoo, it gains an additional Steel-type along with a metallic spiral shell due to its mucus having a reaction to the iron-rich waters of the region. Goomy and its Hisuian evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shelter. Additionally, prior to Generation IX, Goomy and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability.\"\n",

      "    \"descripcion\": \"Dartrix is an avian Pokémon that resembles an owl. Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped facial disc, is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward. This alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength.[1] Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom. In Hisui, Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type. Dartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have the Ability Long Reach.\"\n",

The light blue dorsal fin has a pattern of three spots arranged in a triangle, while its horizontal tail fin lacks spots. Its pectoral fins and belly fins match its main body color.

It also uses these massive earthquakes to drive away any foes that come near it, going on rampages in the process. This behavior, along with sightings of Whiscash's leaping from lakes, has caused people to mistaken it for starting earthquakes. It lives in a nest at the bottom of ponds and swamps, and is territorial over them. Whiscash tends to wait silently for prey to come to it. This gluttonous fish will eat anything that is alive, sometimes whole, and was shown in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Whiscash and Ash to eat inanimate objects as well.

Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male. The wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Sappy Ending. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it also observed in the episode Bye Bye Butterfree flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.

There is a white, mask-like marking on its face. This marking extends down its neck before ending in a tuft of feathers on its chest. A large crest sweeps upward from the back of its head with a red stripe along the top that ends at its beak. The undersides of Pikipek's wings are white, and it has thin gray legs and feet. It has a flat tail. Despite its slender appearance, Pikipek has powerful neck muscles and is able to strike 16 times per second with its beak. Pikipek does not feel pain when using its neck muscles. This allows it to not only drill through wood, but shatter stone as well. The holes it drills in trees are used for nesting, storing food, and collecting small, glittering objects. The noise of this Pokémon pecking can be used to communicate with others. This Pokémon feeds on Berries and is able to attack opponents by zipping the leftover seeds at them. These shots have enough force to embed the seeds in trees.[1] Talonflame is a natural predator of Pikipek, while Pikipek itself preys on Metapod. It generally lives in humid forests.\"\n",

When moving quickly, these appendages tend to disappear, in favor of a long similar-looking trail of blue electricity. It has teeth, and its unique, blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base form is possessing a light bulb. Rotom lack any sort of circulatory system or pulse.[1] Rotom have the ability to enter and control appliances. They typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Get Your Rotom Running!. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, and Drone Rotom are some examples. Additionally, in Galar, the Rotom Phone is used to power the Rotom Bike. Some of these forms allow Rotom to speak human languages, and demonstrate that Rotom are highly intelligent. Rotom tend to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors. In the Pokémon the Series episode Rotom's Wish!, a specific Rotom was shown to have the ability to time travel.\"\n",

Its body is primarily cool gray, although it has dark blue colorations on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past Archaludon's head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of Archaludon's spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail. Archaludon's head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth. Archaludon's hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, Archaludon has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from Archaludon's surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own.[1] Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on Archaludon's head and tail. When Archaludon faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy.[1] When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster.[1] Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. Archaludon often digs holes in the mountains while searching for food. Archaludon and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon, are the only known Pokémon that can have Stalwart as an Ability.

Atop its head, Sinistcha wears a 茶筅 chasen (a bamboo whisk used to prepare and stir matcha tea)[1], which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, Sinistcha is not biologically related to Polteageist. Sinistcha lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, Sinistcha would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force.

The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them.

The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell. Pecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokémon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, respectively. It serves its mochi to Pokémon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to Pecharunt's will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's friends from Paldea. According to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet.[1] It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others.[2] Pecharunt can retreat into its shell and remain dormant for years. After being knocked out in Kitakami, it started being known as the \\\"Never-Rotting Peach\\\" due to its peach-like shell. Humans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. It can even command humans and Pokémon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling many beings at once.

Due to its immense size, it can make giant splashes by jumping out of the water and then crashing back down. These shockwaves allow Wailord to knock out its opponents and herd its prey. Wailord is able to eat large quantities at one time, such as schools of Wishiwashi. However, it will flee from Wishiwashi when the latter is in its School Form. Wailord has an easygoing temperament and loves to play. Its size causes it to have almost no natural enemies; its only known predator is Dhelmise. Wailord lives in the sea in large groups called pods. These pods, which often include Wailmer, travel together in order to search for food. When a Wailmer is attacked by its predators Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works to defend it. Wailord can dive deep at 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in one breath. Wailord is popular due to its size. As a result, Wailord-watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world. However, Wailord are known to be driven away by fishermen when they become too numerous, so they don't eat too much fish Pokémon.\"\n",

Quaxwell's legs are long and its feet are yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes. The crest above Quaxwell's head is capable of absorbing impacts, and is used by Quaxwell to shield itself from incoming attacks. Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape.[1] Quaxwell has a serious, stoic personality, though it is also known to be temperamental. It learns and practices dance routines by observing the movements of people and Pokémon from various regions. Quaxwell is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. Flocks of Quaxwell train by running their legs through shallow waters, and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks.[1] As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Quaxwell maintains its beautiful posture. However, the daily training it maintains can occasionally leave it too tired to care for its coif. As a result, the coif is usually left messy as it sleeps.\"\n",

Regigigas ran out of crystals after building Regidrago's head and it was sealed away by ancient people, who feared the destruction it would cause should it ever be completed.[1] Due to its body composition, Regidrago is said to have the most powerful Dragon-type moves of all Pokémon,[1] along with the power of every Dragon-type Pokémon. Regidrago can fire an attack made of intense dragon energy by combining its arms to form a mouth[1]. There is an unproven academic theory that posits that Regidrago's arms originated from the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. It can convert its life-force into power, attacking its opposers.

      "    \"descripcion\": \"Eternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien Pokémon. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pokémon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Eternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and two young humans. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pokémon Masters EX, Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokémon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokémon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect. As depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Sword and Shield: \\\"From Here to Eternatus!\\\", Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokémon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokémon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokémon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pokémon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In the animated series, Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the \\\"Darkest Day\\\", as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago. As seen in chapter Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry of the Pokémon Adventures manga, Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in PASS38, both met during the first Darkest Day. Eternatus is an extraterrestrial Pokémon that came to the Pokémon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid (referred to as a Wishing Star) landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a cavern called the Max Lair. Eternatus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam.\"\n",

Smoochum is a female-only species, with no male counterpart.\"\n",

Rather than walking, this small Pokémon bounces like a ball to move around, as its body is extremely soft and elastic — although it may not be able to stop if it does this. As Igglybuff moves, it secretes sweat with a sweet fragrance, which calms the emotions of its foes. Although it has singing abilities, Igglybuff is not able to sing for long periods due to its underdeveloped vocal cords. It often gets a sore throat from singing too frequently. When Igglybuff gets praised, its singing slowly becomes better and better. Igglybuff tend to live in the grasslands close by freshwater streams. It uses water from the streams to gargle in its sore throat. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Igglybuff is known to bounce around while sleeping.[1]On rare occasions, Igglybuff practices its singing as it dreams.\"\n",

It has a curl on its forehead and a curled-up tail. Cleffa lives in mountainous regions, typically found at meteor impact sites. Sightings of Cleffa become more likely during nights illuminated by shooting stars, where they dance the night away; this dance is said to bring good fortune to any who witness it. They quench their thirst the next morning by drinking dew. It is fascinated by anything resembling stars and meteors, such as Minior. Because of this, as well as its own star-shaped silhouette, Cleffa is commonly believed to have arrived on a shooting star. The Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy Tales showed that its evolved forms (and therefore Cleffa itself) are actually extraterrestrial Pokémon. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Cleffa is known to sway its body similar to a rocking craddle while sleeping.[1] The way it moves while sleeping resembles a twinking star in the night.

Kleavor swings these appendages to carve and chop down trees, marking its territory.[1] It also uses these heavy stone axes to finish off prey. Kleavor is an Evolution of Scyther caused by Black Augurites, which are said to originate from volcanic regions in Hisui but are now extremely rare. The stones that adorn Kleavor's body often get chipped during fierce fights; larger chips are a sign that it is experienced in battle.

Kleavor's nature is described as being rough, crude, and violent. Kleavor is implied to be at the brink of extinction in the present day, only known to be found in Blueberry Academy, located somewhere in Unova's ocean, specifically in its Terarium's Canyon Biome.

The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes. Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Poké Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new.

Necrozma's body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the \\\"brain prism\\\", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white.[1] Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each. Necrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a \\\"reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts\\\" and \\\"a creature almost like an Ultra Beast\\\". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pokémon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pokémon. This energy is consumed by Pokémon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pokémon such as Solgaleo and Lunala. Necrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma steals light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a \\\"pillager of light\\\" in ancient times. Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism. These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits.[2] It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light. Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis. In Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon, the Aether Foundation confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, \\\"UB: Black\\\". As seen in Filling the Light with Darkness, Necrozma is capable of absorbing a world's Ultra Aura, which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past. Necrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability.\"\n",

Addtionally, Sivally's speed and senses are increased due to evolution.

However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor Mohn's research tells that Cosmog can also open Ultra Wormholes when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to Lusamine, the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes.[1] Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast, and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as “The child of the stars” by the people of Alola. When angered, Cosmog's wisps will puff up in a comedic way. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it.[2] Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to teleport away should things get dicey. This Pokémon can also be created by Solgaleo and Lunala, probably as a some type of reproduction. The guardian deities watch and protect Cosmog until it fully evolves and returns to Ultra Space to repeat the cycle.\"\n",

Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair. Tapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the \\\"eye\\\" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines. As the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to purify anything it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy.[1] As seen in Run, Heroes, Run!, Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. As stated in Memories in the Mist!, long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again. Tapu Fini is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in the Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Fini and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. Tapu Fini and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness.

Each of its hands has five fingers, while each of its feet has three toes. It has two large white eyes with black irises. A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout. Grookey has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color.[1] As depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Beyond Chivalry… Aiming to be a Leek Master!, it can even restore weakened plant-like Pokémon such as Bellsprout. Grookey's green fur can create energy from the sunlight, similar to how plants use their green leaves to photosynthesize. Grookey is said to be full of boundless curiosity.[1] It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. In Generation IX, Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability.\"\n",

Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet. Garbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It can also finish off opponents by belting them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps, where it devours garbage in order to grow larger. Consuming garbage also allows Garbodor to create poisons in its body, the type of which depends on the kind of garbage eaten. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Alolan Grimer and Muk, which prey on Garbodor, were introduced to its habitat.

During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pokémon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime.

Its eyes are red with black markings around them. There are three clusters of red spikes on its body: one with three points on top of its head, one with two points between its shoulders, and a diamond-shaped one near the tip of its tail. While most of its body is blue, its lower jaw is yellow and there is an asymmetrical, yellow-and-blue pattern around its chest that resembles a spotted animal skin. Although Croconaw is described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible. The tips of its teeth are slanted backward similar to a barbed fish hook; this makes them impossible to remove once embedded in something. Once Croconaw has bitten down onto something, it will not let go until it loses its teeth; any missing teeth will quickly grow back. Croconaw can rarely be found near water. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Croconaw and its evolutionary relatives are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep. During sleep, as one half of Croconaw's brain rests, the eye on the same side opens. This allows Croconaw to watch for enemy attacks while it sleeps.\"\n",

It has black markings that resemble briefs[1] and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each. Machamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In Generation VII, Strength was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In Alola, Machamp is used as a Ride Pokémon called Machamp Shove, where Marchamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way. In Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move. \"\n",

It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away. Octillery is a relaxed Pokémon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. Octillery's ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. Octillery also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Octillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pokémon Snap, an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper.\"\n",

Its body weakens if its skin dries out, so it plays in the mud on beaches when the tide is low to replenish fluids. It is capable of moving faster through mud than water. With its sturdy legs, it has a good footing in mud that allows it to overwhelm struggling opponents. Marshtomp lives in swamps and other wetlands. In Generation III, Muddy Water was its signature move.\"\n",

Luvdisc is seen as symbol of love and romance; loving couples gave this Pokémon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is said that any couple who sees a Luvdisc will be blessed with eternal love, thus honeymoon hotels usually release this Pokémon into their pools.

Trubbish has oval-shaped eyes and large triangular teeth that resemble broken glass. Its arms look like trash spilling out of small tears in the bag with pink and blue objects protruding out of them. Its feet are dark green and stubby. This Pokémon was created when a mixture of domestic and industrial waste underwent a chemical reaction of some sort. Trubbish emits noxious, burp-like gases which, when inhaled, will render the victim bedridden for a week. This gas can also prove fatal when inhaled by young Pokémon and children. As evidenced in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Here Comes the Trubbish Squad!, Trubbish's ear-like tufts stand straight up when startled, are lifted if happy, and lowered if it is feeling down. Furthermore, in the same episode, it is also explained that once Trubbish befriends a person, it will cease expelling foul odors. It prefers unsanitary places, such as garbage dumps, where it finds trash and other rotten stuff such as moldy apples for food. Alolan Grimer is a common enemy of Trubbish, and Alolan Muk preys on it. Galarian Weezing feed on the fumes produced by Trubbish.\"\n",

It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed. Yamma's eyes ensure the prey will not escape its sight, even when behind. It can also generate shock waves capable of breaking glass or even launching a house skyward by flapping its wings very fast. Yanma is often found in wooded and swampy areas.

It always carries a blue formal cane made of ice. Mr. Rime is highly skilled in tap dancing and waves its ice cane while it moves gracefully. It is popular due to its amusing movements and has been known to influence the Mime Jr. of the Galar region to learn its dancing steps, leading them to evolve into Galarian Mr. Mime. It can release psychic powers through the pattern on its belly. Mr. Rime and its pre-Evolution, Galarian Mr. Mime, are the only known Pokémon that can have Screen Cleaner as an Ability.\"\n",

Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pokémon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation, Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.

In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pokémon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish.

This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. Occasionally, its claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea. Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when it was alive. From Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer, are the only known Pokémon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability.\"\n",

It has a long, tubular mouth, narrow, black eyes, a fin-like ridge above each eye, and spiny pectoral fins. It also has a large, coiled tail. It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce numbness and even fainting in humans, but it is still prized among practitioners of traditional medicine. Seadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest. During this time, the male's venom also becomes thicker and stronger than usual.\"\n",

It has a tightly curled tail that it can use as both a balance and an anchor when caught in a strong current. In safer environments, it uses its tail to play with other members of its species. Horsea feeds on insects and moss gathered from rocks. If Horsea senses danger, it sprays water or dense black ink from its mouth at its attacker. It can shoot more precisely at insects flying above the surface of the water. Horsea nests in coral reefs and islands throughout oceans with gentle currents. Many Eggs are laid every year, and the young are raised by the male Horsea rather than the female. Horsea swims with dance-like motions, creating whirlpools in the process. Horsea tend to compete with each other to see who can create the biggest whirlpool.\"\n",

Its abdomen is black in the center and light blue with black dots on the outside. It has six leaf-like wings that are orange in color and have small black spots. Volcarona releases burning scales from its wings to engulf the battlefield in a sea of fire. Volcarona's flames are said to provide a replacement for the sun when the atmosphere is dark with volcanic ash, and some legends claim that it hatched from a cocoon of raging flames to save people and Pokémon in freezing climates. It was feared as the rage of the sun by ancient people, and it was even worshiped as a deity of fire in some places, they even referred to it as the embodiment of the sun. Volcarona's shrine in Relic Castle remains as a testament to the respect it commanded. Despite being worshiped in cold regions, it is unpopular in hot regions due to its burning body. Volcarona is also considered dangerous due to how it scatters hot burning scales, which can rob the surrounding air of its oxygen. Slither Wing and Iron Moth bear a resemblance to Volcarona. Slither Wing is believed to be a revived ancestor of Volcarona. Iron Moth is believed to be Volcarona's descendant, possibly a UFO being controlled by alien life for observation. Volcarona and its Paradox Pokémon counterpart, Iron Moth are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fiery Dance.\"\n",

Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail. Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \\\"divine Pokémon\\\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.[1] In Generation II, Dragonair and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

Dratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the \\\"Mirage Pokémon\\\", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was.[1] However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called Coiled Sleep, Wriggly Sleep, Uncoiled Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. In Generation II, Dratini and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\"\n",

At the end of its abdomen is a light green spinneret. It has six light green legs with opaque bubbles around the joints. The tips of its legs are dark gray. Araquanid uses the bubble around its head as both a weapon and a protective shield. The bubbles it launches will have a sticky effect. It will headbutt enemies with it, and small Pokémon can be sucked in and drowned. Foes it traps inside these bubbles will lose consciousness before getting torn apart by Araquanid's gnashing jaws. Subdued prey can also be stored inside when the Araquanid is not hungry. However, it will also bring weaker Pokémon and valuable items into the bubble for protection. Notably, it carries around its Dewpider children while feeding them with food within the head bubble. A special Araquanid in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Lana's trial in Brooklet Hill. This Araquanid possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Araquanid and completing the trial is a Waterium Z.

Two half-circle openings similar to eyes are located above Cursola's core. Together, the three openings resemble a screaming face with a sad or pained expression. On its ectoplasmic body, two small branches below the core serve as its arms and one small branch on its forehead serves as a horn. It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks. Cursola's overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown — one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the Cursola.[1] Cursola is the only known Pokémon that can have Perish Body as an Ability.\"\n",

Sometimes Dewpider will secretly swap which legs will hold up the bubble. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings. Several triangular flaps extend upward and attach to the bubble over its head. The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and a light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which the anime  has shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles. Dewpider can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over their head allows them to breathe on land. Dewpider uses the sticky silk it creates to form a sturdy water bubble that will rarely burst. Additionally, the bubble protects its soft head and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two Dewpider meet, they compare bubbles and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way.  It supports the water bubble that envelops its head with three of its legs.
