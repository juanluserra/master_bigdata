    "descripcion": "Impidimp is a small, fuchsia Pokémon with a large head, small body, and wiry limbs. Its hands have three fingers each while its feet don't have digits. Its face has a purple \"mask\", prominent pointed ears, large eyes with small pupils, a long nose with a single nostril, and a fanged mouth. It usually has its purple tongue sticking out. The back of its head sports a tuft of hair that resembles a bat wing. It and its evolved forms are male-only species. Impidimp is a mischievous Pokémon that loves to sneak into people's houses to steal things and generally be a nuisance to their occupants. This allows it to feed on negative emotions that it causes, sucking them through its nose. In contrast, Impidimp itself will become irritable if it has no negative emotions to feed on. Impidimp live in groups, practicing their troublemaking skills on each other. In Generation IX, Confide is its signature move."
