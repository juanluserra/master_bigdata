    "descripcion": "Tandemaus is a Pokémon comprising two separate mouse-like rodent Pokémon which work together as one, much like Exeggcute or Falinks. Each individual is small, white, and bipedal, and has a spherical head with large ears and stubby limbs with large paws. Each one also has two black beady eyes, a tiny black nose with short whiskers, and a long tail which curls up and ends with a bulbous tip. One of the pair has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its chest which resembles a shirt, while the other has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its legs, which resembles a pair of pants. When they open their mouths, which take up over half of their faces when fully open, a single upper incisor can be seen on the insides of each one. The pair that forms Tandemaus sticks together no matter what. They exhibit great teamwork: they share any food they find equally within the pair, and they build their nest together using materials they've gathered with their incisors. Tandemaus's evolution into Maushold is considered somewhat of a mystery, as the little individuals that form the group seem to appear out of nowhere. Tandemaus and its evolved form, Maushold, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Population Bomb."
