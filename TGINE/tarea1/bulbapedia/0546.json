    "descripcion": "Cottonee is a white, circular Pokémon. It has white, puffy sections on the top of its head and its underside. Behind it is a green, star-shaped section similar to the area where a plant connects to its produce. It has orange, oval-shaped eyes, and furled, notched leaves on the sides of its body. Cottonee is blown around by the wind because of its lightweight composition. The only circumstance in which it cannot be blown by the wind is when it has been soaked by rain, which weighs it down and makes it soggy. Afterwards, this Pokémon will stay under a tree until it dries, so that it may be blown by the wind again. During the mating season, Cottonee blow in the wind in large groups. Its cotton can be used as a defensive mechanism; when threatened, it will expel cotton as a distraction so that it may escape. The lost cotton will grow back quickly. Cottonee's cotton is used to manufacture top-quality pillows and beds that are soft, puffy, light, and airy. When Cottonee's cotton is weaved together with Eldegoss's cotton, it makes a cloth that is popular with many luxury brands."
