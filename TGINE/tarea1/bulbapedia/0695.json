    "descripcion": "Heliolisk is a bipedal Pokémon that resembles a yellow lizard. Its head is mostly black with a yellow lower jaw. It has blue eyes with a pointed spike over each. Covering its neck is a black frill with orange spikes around the rim. This frill can be raised to frame its head if needed. Its hands and feet are black with three digits each and there is an orange band with triangular markings around each leg. It has a long, tapering tail that is orange and then black at the tip. Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper, simply by flaring open its frill. When its frill is flared while it basks in the sun, it can generate enough electricity to power an entire city. This electricity can be used to stimulate its muscles, which boosts the strength in its legs. This allows it to sprint a hundred yards in five seconds, even being capable of running on water without breaking surface tension, as shown in New Pokémon Snap and in the TCG. In Galar, there was an old desert culture that highly treasured the Heliolisk due to treasure having arrived with them. Prior to Generation VIII, Heliolisk and its pre-evolved form, Helioptile, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electrify."
