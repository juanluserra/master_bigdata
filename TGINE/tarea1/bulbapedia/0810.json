    "descripcion": "Grookey is a small, monkey-like Pokémon with a green body, a brown tail, brown wedge-shaped ears, orange hands and feet, and an orange snout. Each of its hands has five fingers, while each of its feet has three toes. It has two large white eyes with black irises. A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout. Grookey has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color.[1] As depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Beyond Chivalry… Aiming to be a Leek Master!, it can even restore weakened plant-like Pokémon such as Bellsprout. Grookey's green fur can create energy from the sunlight, similar to how plants use their green leaves to photosynthesize. Grookey is said to be full of boundless curiosity.[1] It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. In Generation IX, Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability."
