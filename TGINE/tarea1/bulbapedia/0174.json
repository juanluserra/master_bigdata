    "descripcion": "Igglybuff is a small, bipedal balloon-like Pokémon that is completely pink. Its body can turn deep pink when the temperature increases, or when it sings continuously. It has a rounded tuft of hair on top of its head, a small swirl-like pattern on its forehead, and red eyes. Igglybuff has small, stubby limbs, and is usually seen levitating in the air. Rather than walking, this small Pokémon bounces like a ball to move around, as its body is extremely soft and elastic — although it may not be able to stop if it does this. As Igglybuff moves, it secretes sweat with a sweet fragrance, which calms the emotions of its foes. Although it has singing abilities, Igglybuff is not able to sing for long periods due to its underdeveloped vocal cords. It often gets a sore throat from singing too frequently. When Igglybuff gets praised, its singing slowly becomes better and better. Igglybuff tend to live in the grasslands close by freshwater streams. It uses water from the streams to gargle in its sore throat. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Igglybuff is known to bounce around while sleeping.[1]On rare occasions, Igglybuff practices its singing as it dreams."
