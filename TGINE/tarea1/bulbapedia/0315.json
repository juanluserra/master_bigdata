    "descripcion": "Roselia is a small, light green bipedal Pokémon. It has three thorns on top of its head, and it has black eyes with long eyelashes. Visible from the back is a small stretch of yellow coloration around its neck much like a collar. There are leaves extending from its shoulders like epaulettes. It has a leaf skirt with a yellow stripe running down the front. A male will have a shorter leaf than a female. It holds a rose in each of its hands, a red one in its right, and a blue one in its left. However, it is said that it will occasionally have unusually colored flowers. Roselia's aroma brings serenity, but the thorns on its head contain a vicious poison. The more healthy it is, the more pleasant its flowers' aroma. It shoots sharp thorns at anything that tries to steal its flowers and uses different poisons in each hand when it attacks. It lives in grassy areas where it drinks nutrient-rich spring water. Roseilia's thorns are used as part of an old tradition, challenging an opponent to a duel by sending these thorns. In Generation III, Grass Whistle was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
