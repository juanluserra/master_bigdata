    "descripcion": "Honedge is a Pok√©mon that resembles a sword from medieval times. Its body is a silver sword with a light gray hilt. Embedded in the hilt is a blue gem with a dark center that appears to be its eye, which is said to be its true form. Attached to the pommel is a long, dark blue cloth with a swirl design in lighter blue at the tip; the tip of the sash splits into four tassels. Honedge's sheath is dark brown with curved lines resembling a triquetra across its surface. Near the top of the sheath are two rings and a hole that in conjunction with the shape of Honedge's blade create the illusion of a face, with eyes and a mouth. A third ring extends onto the hilt and encircles its actual eye. Honedge is said to have been born from a person's soul after they were killed by the sword that it resides in. Its sash is prehensile, and it holds its sheath with it when battling. Honedge is known to wrap its sash on people's arms and suck their life energy if they dare to grab it by the hilt."
