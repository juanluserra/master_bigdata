    "descripcion": "Gigalith is a blue, quadrupedal Pokémon, with various spiny, red-orange, crystalline features jutting out from all over its body; two appear along its back, one on its chest, and one topping each of its four feet. Each foot also bears two claws of a similar appearance and is connected to the body by gray joints. The yellow, front-facing ears of its previous evolutionary relatives are now filled in with red and appear to have become full-fledged eyes. Several of the aforementioned red crystals also appear on its face; three below its eyes, one in the middle resembling a crest, and two other crystals connected to the sides of its head. Gigalith compresses energy in the core inside its body, allowing it to fire attacks powerful enough to blow away mountains. When it fires these attacks at full power, the sheer force of the blast creates multiple cracks on its body. It can also store sunlight in its orange crystals, magnify it within its body, and shoot powerful energy balls that can destroy dump trucks from its mouth, though it loses this ability at night or during rain. It lives in caves and tunnels deep underground. Gigalith is a hardy Pokémon with hefty horsepower and is a popular partner for construction workers and miners. In Galar, it works with Copperajah in construction sites and mines."
