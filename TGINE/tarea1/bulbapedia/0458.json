    "descripcion": "Mantyke is a Pokémon that resembles a manta ray. It has a round body with wide, flat fins. Its back is dark-blue, while its underside is light blue. There are two red spots with white outlines and a light-blue, curved line on its back. These markings give the overall impression of a smiling face and vary slightly in each region. It has two long, curving antennae on top of its head and black eyes with eyelash-like markings underneath. Despite its appearance, Mantyke is an effective swimmer. Its antennae are used to sense ocean currents. Mantyke is a friendly Pokémon that can be found approaching boats and swimming near the ocean's surface with schools of Remoraid. It often works together with Remoraid to repel attackers. Spending time with the Remoraid schools will eventually cause Mantyke to evolve into Mantine. Due to its friendly nature, Mantyke are very easy to tame. Mantyke are also super-popular in beach activities involving swimming tours. The Mantyke that live in Galar appear to move slower due to the cold waters of the region."
