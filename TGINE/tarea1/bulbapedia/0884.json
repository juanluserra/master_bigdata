    "descripcion": "Duraludon is a tall bipedal dinosaur-like Pokémon with large feet, a chunky tail, and a head integrated into its neck. Its body is mainly light gray and dark blue, with zigzag patterns running down its body, gray bands around its arms, and two black slits on its lower chest. Its hands have four triangular indents. Duraludon's head has a small red section and multiple slits on it. It also has yellow eyes with green pupils, and it appears to be permanently scowling. It moves its upper jaw when opening its mouth. Duraludon armor has a smooth feel, similar to a mirror finish. Duraludon's body is made of strong, but surprisingly light, special metal. The armor is both durable and resistant to scratches. Weighing only 88 lbs. (40 kg), it can move very fast. However, its body can easily rust, so it lives in caves and mountainous areas and avoids rain. The metal body also has a risk of overheating, so it vents the heat out through the slits inside its tail. It uses its arms, which have slightly different shapes from each other, to grind down rock surfaces for food. Duraludon has a rivalry with Tyranitar, which it shares its habitat with, and they often battle each other in the mountains of Galar.[1] It mainly resides in caves and mountains within cold areas. Duraludon and its evolved form, Archaludon, are the only known Pokémon that can have Stalwart as an Ability."
