    "pokemon": "Binacle",
    "pokedex_number": "0688",
    "origin": "Binacle seems to be based on the goose barnacle, due to their general shape and use of a connective \"stalk\" to cling to rocks. Considering it survives together with a second Binacle, it may possibly be a reference to the rarer, same species symbiosis. Considering its hand-like body, and its eyes within its \"palms\", Binacle may have also been based on the hamsa.",
    "description": "Binacle is a Pokémon that resembles a goose barnacle. It also has the appearance of a hand and arm; the “hand” serves as its head. Its head is brown with puffy orange cheeks and an orange marking where a nose would be located. On top of its head are three long claws. Its body is orange with a white band around the middle. Binacle is always found as a pair living in a single gray rock, and they need to cooperate with each other in order to survive. It moves by stretching and contracting its bodies and yanking the rock along in a hopping motion. The pair has a tendency of squabbling with one another. When they do, one of them will move and find a different rock with a different Binacle to live alongside with. Binacle eats seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
