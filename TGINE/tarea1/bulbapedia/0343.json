    "pokemon": "Baltoy",
    "pokedex_number": "0343",
    "origin": "Baltoy appears to be based on a balancing toy with the design of a 遮光器土偶 Shakōki-dogū—a \"spaceman\" clay figurine from the Jōmon period of Japanese history. It also seems to resemble Hopi Kachina figures.",
    "description": "Baltoy is a small Pokémon that resembles a tan figurine made out of clay or mud. There are arching, red markings over its eyes, which usually appear closed. A red stripe encircles its body and forms a ring on its belly. It has flat appendages that resemble arms. A spike protrudes from the top of its head and another, smaller spike under its body acts as its foot. It moves by spinning on this single, pointed foot, and balances upright to sleep. Baltoy is usually found in ruins and old graveyards, where it assembles with its kind and unleashes loud cries. Old cave wall paintings depict it living with people in ancient times. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Me, Myself and Time, an ancient civilization used Baltoy for time travel when spinning on a magic circle artifact."
