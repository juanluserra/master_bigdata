    "pokemon": "Glameow",
    "pokedex_number": "0431",
    "origin": "Glameow seems to be based on a domestic cat and a rhythmic gymnast (specifically a ribbon gymnast). Its head being shaped like the crescent moon may allude to the nocturnal lifestyle of cats. Glameow's tail which consists of a white fluff on a spring may be based on a type of cat toy.",
    "description": "Glameow is a gray feline Pok√©mon with a slender physique. It has a crescent-shaped head with two white-tipped ears. It also has a white muzzle, a small black nose, pink eyelids, yellow eyes with blue irises, and two rows of thin whiskers. Its neck has a ruff-like fringe, and its legs have similar fringes. Its feet are tipped with white and have pink paw pads on the underside. It has a long, curled, spring-shaped tail and a white fluff at the tip of it. Glameow has sharp claws and a powerful helical tail, and its eyes are capable of using hypnotic powers. It tends to be spiteful, fickle, and even cowardly, having a tendency to hook its claws into the nose of its trainer if it's not fed. When it's happy and purring with affection, it demonstrates movements with its tail, like a dancing ribbon. As it has a domesticated quality, it tends to appear in urban areas. Glameow is rather popular amongst trainers due to its fickle nature. Glameow is also known to be a very cunning opponent to face in battle, which occurs only if it was provoked. Because of its craven nature, Glameow has a high chance of fleeing trainers when encountered in the wild."
