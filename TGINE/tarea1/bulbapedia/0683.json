    "descripcion": "Aromatisse is a bipedal, semi-humanoid Pokémon. Its head and upper body are covered in fluffy purple fur or feathers. The exact hue varies: they are vivid purple in the official art, and pinkish-purple in all other appearances of the Pokémon. Around its lower body is an even fluffier mass of pink fur, resembling a skirt. There is a black bow on its lower back. It has a pale blue-gray face with a small, curved beak or snout that resembles a mask worn by plague doctors or a masquerade mask. Its eyes are black with red sclerae and pupils and full black lashes. It has two wavy ears or tufts with yellow centers on its head. Each of its hands has three yellow claws, and it has paw-like feet with three toes. Aromatisse can give off a variety of different smells, ranging from a pleasant fragrance to bolster its allies to an odor so repugnant that its opponent loses the will to fight. The scent emitted by its pink fur is so strong that its companions and Trainer will gradually lose the ability to smell. In Generation VI, Aromatic Mist was its signature move. Additionally, prior to Generation VIII, Aromatisse and its pre-evolved form, Spritzee, were the only known Pokémon that could have Aroma Veil as an Ability."
