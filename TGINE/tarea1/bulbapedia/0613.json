    "pokemon": "Cubchoo",
    "pokedex_number": "0613",
    "origin": "Cubchoo is based on a polar bear cub. The mucus it possesses is probably inspired by the fact that cold weather often results in a runny nose.",
    "description": "Cubchoo is a bipedal, ursine Pokémon with a light blue head and neck. Its head is slightly pointed at the top and has large round ears; shiny, dark, oval eyes; and a darker blue muzzle. Cubchoo has a shiny dark nose, from which a considerable amount of light blue nasal mucus — the source of its attacks — constantly droops. The lower part of its body is white. It has rounded forepaws, digit-less feet with black paw pads, and a small round tail. Cubchoo's mucus can cause frostbite, and is inhaled and used for its attacks, as well as smeared on anyone it dislikes. Cubchoo's mucus is also an indicator of its health. When it is healthy, its mucus is sticky and its Ice-type moves become stronger. However, if it is in bad health, the mucus becomes watery or even nonexistent, which weakens its Ice-type techniques. Cubchoo inhabits cold regions, along the shorelines."
