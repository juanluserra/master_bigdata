    "descripcion": "Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips. From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. In the TCG, Mr. Mime is shown to be adept at rock climbing. Mr. Mime is usually very rare but can be found in suburban areas. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is hard to tell whether Mr. Mime is either sleeping or pretending to be asleep due to its masterful pantomime skills.[1] In Generation II, Substitute was its signature move. Prior to Generation VI and in Generation VIII, Mr. Mime and its pre-evolved form, Mime Jr., were the only known Pokémon that could have Filter as an Ability."
