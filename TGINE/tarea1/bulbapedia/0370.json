    "descripcion": "Luvdisc is a fishlike Pokémon with a relatively flat body in the shape of a heart. It is primarily light pink, with pale lips and circular markings on its cheeks. Its body is covered in heart-shaped scales. Luvdisc lives in shallow tropical warm seas, where it makes its nest in the branches of Corsola or coral reefs. During its breeding season, it forms groups that turn the ocean's surface bright pink. As shown in Luvdisc is a Many Splendored Thing!, when two Luvdisc kiss, they are able to use their slender bodies as wings in order to fly for short periods of time. If a Luvdisc is left alone, it becomes disheartened and open to attacks from predators, such as Pelipper. Luvdisc is seen as symbol of love and romance; loving couples gave this Pokémon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is said that any couple who sees a Luvdisc will be blessed with eternal love, thus honeymoon hotels usually release this Pokémon into their pools. A tradition in some places is to gift a Luvdisc to a person someone loves. At one point in the past, Luvdisc was overfished due to a rumor that its scales would allow one to find their sweetheart."
