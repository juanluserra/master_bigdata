    "descripcion": "Snorunt is a small, black Pokémon with an ovoid body. It has circular, light blue eyes, wide teeth, and spherical hands and feet that lack digits. It is covered with a yellow cloak that gives it a triangular outline. The coat is rimmed with an orange stripe and has three orange diamond markings on the back. As its evolved form Glalie has a body of rock, Snorunt may also be made of rock. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, defeating a Snorunt, Glalie, or Froslass will yield some \"Snorunt fur\", suggesting the cloak is made of fur. Well-adapted to life in colder climates, it subsists on snow and ice and can survive temperatures as low as −150 degrees Fahrenheit. Snorunt is also a social creature, living and traveling with other Snorunt in groups of five. The group can live together in harmony while residing underneath giant leaves. It can be found in caves, particularly when the outside lacks snow or areas with heavy snowfall. Despite this, the Snorunt population in Alola shows it can survive in some places with warm weather. Additionally, it has been known to visit human dwellings. There is a legend that any home a Snorunt visits and lives near will prosper for generations. There is a tradition where houses would leave a lump of ice made from pure water for Snorunt to have when visiting. Playing with Snorunt is a favorite childhood memory for rich people who live in cold areas. It is believed that if Snorunt shows up during the night, they will cause heavy snow to appear in the morning."
