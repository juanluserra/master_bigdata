    "descripcion": "Gholdengo is a bipedal humanoid Pokémon whose body is composed of 1,000 Gimmighoul Coins stacked together, giving it a golden, cylindrical appearance. Its face has oval eyes and a mouth displaying a crooked smile. Its body has skinny arms with large hands, and short, stumpy legs with no toes. It has three fingers on each hand and four tufts of dreadlock-like \"hair\", all made out of coins. It wears the strap from a Gimmighoul's chest as a belt, using it to fasten the chest to its side. The belt buckle has a stylized number 1,000 on it. Gholdengo is capable of creating a golden surfboard out of coins as a means of movement. Gholdengo is a sociable Pokémon, able to quickly befriend anybody. It overwhelms opponents by firing coins at them in quick succession. The coins that form its body are tightly packed, making it able to withstand damage. When attacked by enemies, it can let loose some of the coins on the areas of its body that are hit, in order to absorb the impact.[1] Gholdengo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Make It Rain. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Good as Gold as an Ability."
