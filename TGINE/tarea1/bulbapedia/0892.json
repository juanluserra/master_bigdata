    "origin": "Urshifu may be based on an Asian black bear and a wushu fighter. Its two forms may reference various styles of Chinese martial arts.",
    "description": "Urshifu is a large, bipedal Pokémon resembling a humanoid black bear with a wushu motif. It has a muscular build with long legs and long arms with large paws and claws for striking. Its body and head are covered in gray, black, and white fur, minus the yellow muzzle. The front of Urshifu's pelt slightly resembles a traditional frog buttoned/braid buttoned hanging off ends on both front and back. The fur on Urshifu's head is spikier and flares into a flowing white and black headband. The backs of Urshifu's hands, its knuckles, and the tops of its feet are also white-colored. Urshifu's fighting style and personality are determined by how it trained as a Kubfu and which one of the special scrolls it reads from one of the Towers of Two Fists. Urshifu is the evolved form of the \"secret armor\" of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, and reaches its full potential through either the path of darkness or the path of waters. It is also known to enjoy eating honey, particularly Max Honey found in Honeycalm Island. Wild Urshifu live in mountainous areas of a region far away from the Galar region, training its legs and moves by racing across sheer cliffs. Urshifu is the only known Pokémon that can have Unseen Fist as its Ability."
