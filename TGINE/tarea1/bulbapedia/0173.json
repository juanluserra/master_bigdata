    "pokemon": "Cleffa",
    "pokedex_number": "0173",
    "origin": "Cleffa seems to be based on fairies and pixies since it is a small, playful, magical creature. It may also be inspired by the concept of extraterrestrial life due to its rumored celestial origins and vaguely star-shaped body. It may also reference the mythical Moon rabbit due to its large ears and the fact that it reaches its final evolved form using a Moon Stone.",
    "description": "Cleffa is a small, pink Pokémon that is vaguely star-shaped in appearance. Its ears are completely brown. Cleffa has two small black eyes and a small mouth, and it appears to have a small, permanent blush on its cheeks. It possesses stubby arms and legs, which have no defined digits and come to a point. It has a curl on its forehead and a curled-up tail. Cleffa lives in mountainous regions, typically found at meteor impact sites. Sightings of Cleffa become more likely during nights illuminated by shooting stars, where they dance the night away; this dance is said to bring good fortune to any who witness it. They quench their thirst the next morning by drinking dew. It is fascinated by anything resembling stars and meteors, such as Minior. Because of this, as well as its own star-shaped silhouette, Cleffa is commonly believed to have arrived on a shooting star. The Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy Tales showed that its evolved forms (and therefore Cleffa itself) are actually extraterrestrial Pokémon. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Cleffa is known to sway its body similar to a rocking craddle while sleeping.[1] The way it moves while sleeping resembles a twinking star in the night. Prior to Generation V, Cleffa and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability."
