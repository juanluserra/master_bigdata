    "descripcion": "Kubfu is a small, bearlike Pok√©mon. Its body is primarily dark gray, with a yellow snout and white patches of fur on its head and chest. The patch of fur on its forehead partially covers its black eyes, and has two black downturned eyebrows on top. Additionally, there are two white ribbons of fur located behind its head. Kubfu builds up power and fighting spirit by pulling on these ribbons. Its nose is black and it has a perpetual frown. It has black claws and toes, the latter of which are shaped like triangles. Its tail has a black, spiky appearance. Kubfu works hard to train both body and mind, even using its defeats as a motivation to grow even stronger. It has a unique organ that allows it to create \"fighting energy\" in its lower abdomen through special breathing techniques and intense focusing. Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, Kubfu used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains in the present day, may have descended from the Kubfu that became naturalized in the distant lands they visited in the past[1]. It has been referred to as the \"secret armor\" of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, being gifted by Mustard to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The move it masters by reading one of the special scrolls in one of the Towers of Two Fists will determine which fighting style it takes after evolving. While it can be timid, it can become more brave and confident once trained up. Kubfu loves Kubfu Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and trained with it in the past."
