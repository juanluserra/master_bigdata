    "pokemon": "Sandaconda",
    "pokedex_number": "0844",
    "origin": "Sandaconda appears to be based on an anaconda, though it may also be based on various desert-dwelling snakes, such as the sidewinder, a snake that uses coiling and rippling motions to travel across sandy dunes. As its Pokédex entries state that it blasts sand out of its nose, it also may be based on a double-barreled gun. Sandaconda may also be based on the ball python, a snake that gets its name from its tendency to curl into a ball to hide its head.",
    "description": "Sandaconda is a tan serpent Pokémon with a black and brown pattern all over its body, resembling cracked earth. Around its neck is a dark greenish brown ring, which is its neck pouch. Its long body is coiled in a spiral shape. It has lime green eyes with red bags underneath them and a snout with two prominent nostrils and two fangs. Sandaconda uses its inflated sand pouch to protect its head from harm. The pouch can store over 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of sand, and is very elastic and thick to the point where a Durant's pincers cannot harm it. Sandaconda can contract its body to spray the sand stored in the pouch through its nose with tremendous force, and its unique method of coiling allows it to blast its sand more efficiently. Some of the sand is combined with Sandaconda's own saliva to form sharp pieces of gravel, making it so dangerous that just coming in contact with it will cause lacerations. While Sandaconda may act tough and confident, it will become timid and cowardly the moment it runs out of sand.[1] Sandaconda is known to eat Durant eggs. Sandaconda and its pre-Evolution, Silicobra, are the only known Pokémon that can have Sand Spit as an Ability."
