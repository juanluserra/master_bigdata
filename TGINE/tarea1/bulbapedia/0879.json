    "pokemon": "Copperajah",
    "pokedex_number": "0879",
    "origin": "Given Asia's history with Britain and the use of captive elephants as working animals, Copperajah may be based on an Indian elephant with the digging bucket of a backhoe for a trunk. It may also be inspired by elephant statues often made of copper or bronze, which are common in Indian art and Thai art.",
    "description": "Copperajah is a large, cuboid, elephantine Pokémon with a dark green body and a light teal underbelly. Pokédex entries for its pre-Evolution Cufant suggest that this coloration probably results from the tarnishing of copper in its skin over time. Untarnished copper accents cover most of Copperajah's face, and pattern its ears, feet, trunk, and back. It has short, blunt tusks and a long, broad, muscular trunk that ends in three claw-like protrusions. It has three raised, white ridges on the dorsal end of its trunk, and several rocky protrusions on the dome of its skull. Despite being found in the Galar and Paldea regions, Copperajah and its pre-evolved form Cufant are not native to either of them, having been imported from another region to work with humans. It also works with other Pokémon, such as Gigalith, in construction sites and mines. Copperajah's tarnished skin is resistant to water. It has enough physical strength to pull an airplane, and its trunk is strong enough to crush boulders into powder. It lives in social herds and has a boastful disposition; the more vibrant its skin is, the prouder it will be."
