    "descripcion": "Weedle is a larval insect Pokémon with a segmented body ranging in color from yellow to reddish-brown. Each segment of its body is a sphere. It has a bulbous red nose, two small, black eyes on its face, and two spherical feet on each body segment. The combination of red and yellow in its color scheme creates a bright warning to predators that it is poisonous. Weedle has a conical, two-inch (five-centimeter) venomous stinger on its head and a barbed one on its tail. Weedle can retaliate against attackers and those who step on it with its strong toxin. It can distinguish its favorite kinds of leaves using its acute sense of smell. As a young Bug-type Pokémon, its daily appetite for leaves matches its weight. Weedle can be found in temperate forests and usually hide in grass, bushes, and under the leaves they eat."
