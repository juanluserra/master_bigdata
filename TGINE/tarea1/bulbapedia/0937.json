    "descripcion": "Ceruledge is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Its body is primarily black, though some regions on its head, arms, and legs are dark blue. From each side of its head, a sharp pale blue protrusion extends outward, giving the impression of ears; from the back of its head, a blue and purple fire burns upward, resembling the plume on a knight's helmet. Its eyes have pink irises and wisps emanating from its white pupils. A plate with three pink indentations on its center covers its face. Instead of hands, Ceruledge wields purple-cyan blades created from both fire and ghost energy—specifically, the lingering regrets of the fallen. These blades can grow into great swords in battle, increasing Ceruledge's power in the process.[1] Almost all of Ceruledge's body is covered in an old set of purple and blue armor. Ceruledge is merciless and will do anything to win a battle. It prefers to do close-quarters combat, with a mix of sneak and surprise attacks. By using its quick speed to locate a foe's blind spots, it will then move closer before slashing them with its large swords. Any cuts from Ceruledge's swords will cause wounds that leak life energy, which the swords then absorb.[1] It can focus its bitter feelings into a slashing attack. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode HZ065, the blades can emit heat even when retracted. Ceruledge is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Bitter Blade."
