    "descripcion": "Melmetal is a large, silver Pokémon with a vaguely humanoid build that consists mostly of liquid metal. Many dark-gray hexagonal nuts are embedded in or attached to its body: one around each shoulder, one around the center of each arm, one in each hand, one in each foot, and a small light gray one in the center of its torso. A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire. According to Professor Willow, Melmetal lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms.[1] Melmetal applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pokémon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists.[2] It is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. When it reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born. In ancient times, Melmetal was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. After its death 3,000 years ago, its worshippers placed the Meltan born from it inside Mystery Boxes as a way for Melmetal to return in the future. Melmetal is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Double Iron Bash."
