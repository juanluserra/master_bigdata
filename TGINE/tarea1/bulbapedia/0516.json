    "pokemon": "Simipour",
    "pokedex_number": "0516",
    "origin": "Simipour appears to based on a monkey and a fountain; because of this, it may have been inspired by the water dwelling monkey-like creature ahuizotl, or it may be a visual pun on Sea-Monkeys. The ability to store water in its hair may also reference the Kappa, a Japanese reptilian yōkai that stores water on a dish of sorts on its head. The hair itself resembles a common hairstyle among hippies and popular musicians of the late 60s and the 70s. This contrasts with Simisage's pompadour-like hair, common in the 50s.",
    "description": "Simipour is a simian Pokémon that is primarily blue. Its ears are broad with light blue insides, and it has oval eyes and a small black nose. There are several tufts of fur on its head, which resemble dreadlocks. These tufts can store water, which it collects with its tail. Simipour has a white marking around its neck that resembles a ruff; and a cream-colored face, hands, arms, legs, and feet. Its hands have five fingers, and its feet have three toes. Its tail is tipped with a blue plume, resembling a spout of water. This tail can shoot water at such high pressure that it can destroy a concrete wall. Simipour prefers to live near clean water."
