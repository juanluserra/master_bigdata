    "descripcion": "Simipour is a simian Pok√©mon that is primarily blue. Its ears are broad with light blue insides, and it has oval eyes and a small black nose. There are several tufts of fur on its head, which resemble dreadlocks. These tufts can store water, which it collects with its tail. Simipour has a white marking around its neck that resembles a ruff; and a cream-colored face, hands, arms, legs, and feet. Its hands have five fingers, and its feet have three toes. Its tail is tipped with a blue plume, resembling a spout of water. This tail can shoot water at such high pressure that it can destroy a concrete wall. Simipour prefers to live near clean water."
