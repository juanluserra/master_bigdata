    "descripcion": "Ferroseed is a cave-dwelling Pokémon resembling a durian. It has many green thorns around its body that are used for protection. It has a metallic body with black stripes and polygonal spots, along with small yellow eyes with black pupils. Ferroseed prefer living in mossy caves. It can stick its spikes into cave walls to absorb the minerals from the rocks. If threatened, it can shoot a barrage of spikes so it can escape by rolling away. Ferroseed's aim at throwing spikes will not be good at first, requiring practice to improve it. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Crisis at Ferroseed Research!, Ferroseed can absorb nutrients from rocks and use them to grow moss for oxygen; different rocks create different types of moss with a variety of effects. Notably, its spikes can grow big and strong from consuming the moss. Absorbing nutrients from rocks that come from Chargestone Cave yields disastrous results. Prior to Generation VII, Ferroseed and its evolved form, Ferrothorn, were the only known Pokémon that could have Iron Barbs as an Ability."
