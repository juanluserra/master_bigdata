    "descripcion": "Rotom is a small, orange Pokémon that has a body of plasma. It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms lightning bolt-shaped appendages. When moving quickly, these appendages tend to disappear, in favor of a long similar-looking trail of blue electricity. It has teeth, and its unique, blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base form is possessing a light bulb. Rotom lack any sort of circulatory system or pulse.[1] Rotom have the ability to enter and control appliances. They typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Get Your Rotom Running!. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, and Drone Rotom are some examples. Additionally, in Galar, the Rotom Phone is used to power the Rotom Bike. Some of these forms allow Rotom to speak human languages, and demonstrate that Rotom are highly intelligent. Rotom tend to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors. In the Pokémon the Series episode Rotom's Wish!, a specific Rotom was shown to have the ability to time travel."
