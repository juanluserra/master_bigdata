    "pokemon": "Escavalier",
    "pokedex_number": "0589",
    "origin": "Escavalier may draw inspiration from both the Scaphinotus and Drilus genera of snail-preying beetles, the latter of which pupate inside the stolen shells. Its design also seems to be based on a jousting knight. Both of these inspirations might be connected by the fact that many pieces of medieval european art depict medieval knights fighting snails. Additionally, it might be slightly based on a cuirass.",
    "description": "Escavalier is an insectoid Pokémon with a head sporting the red horsehair crest of a knight's helmet, with a visor underneath it. Its shoulders have large, round metal ridges, from which its thin black arms extend. The arms are tipped with red-striped protrusions resembling jousting lances. Its face and torso are bare of armor, but its lower body is concealed within a swirled gray shell with a red spike on the underside, which was presumably the shell of a Shelmet. Its tough armor protects its entire body. It flies around at high speed, jabbing foes with its lances. It is brave and will face any challenge even if in trouble. Escavalier is a popular Pokémon in the Galar region, with a famous painting showing it dueling Sirfetch'd."
