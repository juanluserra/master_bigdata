    "descripcion": "Litleo is a quadrupedal, leonine Pokémon. It is mostly dark brown with pale brown paws, ears, tail tip, and face. It has a short, rounded muzzle with a reddish-orange nose, round ears with darker interiors,  and circular, black eyes with white pupils. There is a reddish-orange tuft of mane between its ears. Each of its paws has three toes and dark brown paw pads. The tail ends in a pointed, teardrop shape. Litleo is a hot-blooded Pokémon that is curious by nature and is quick to start fights. In battle, its short mane radiates heat. The stronger its opponent, the more heat it produces. Litleo live in prides, where they are raised and taught to hunt by female Pyroar. When a wild Litleo is capable of hunting on its own, it is kicked out of the pride and begins to live alone. It lives in grassy plains and along cliff sides. Prior to Generation VII, Litleo and its evolved form, Pyroar, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Noble Roar."
