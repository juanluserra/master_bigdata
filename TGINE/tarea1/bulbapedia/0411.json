    "descripcion": "Bastiodon is a Pokémon which appears to be a cross between a ceratopsian such as Chasmosaurus and a bulldozer. Its dark gray, square head resembles a castle wall, complete with four cream-yellow, window-like spots with a black outline, three dark gray spikes on the top, and two larger gray spikes in the upper corners. Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail. It is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pokémon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils frequently being found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death."
