    "pokedex_number": "0300",
    "origin": "Skitty appears to be based on a kitten with its tail resembling a cat toy, which is also what the item Fluffy Tail appears to be. The tail also resembles a foxtail grass or a pin holder. Skitty's crescent moon shaped face may allude to rich nocturnal life of cats. Its short legs in comparison to its body are comparable to munchkin cats.",
    "description": "Skitty is a pink, feline Pokémon with a stumpy body and four short legs. On its face is a cream-colored, crescent-shaped marking. It has slit-like eyes and tufted ears with purple interiors. Its slender tail has a bulky pink section at the end, terminated by three pin-like structures with yellow ball-like tips. In battle, its tail puffs out and it threatens opponents with a sharp growl. It is fascinated by moving objects and chases them. It is known to chase its own tail and become dizzy from it. Although it can be difficult to earn its trust, it is very popular due to its adorable looks and behavior. In Generation III, Assist was its signature move. It lives in holes in trees in tropical and temperate forests. Skitty and its evolved form, Delcatty, are the only known Pokémon that can have Normalize as an Ability."
