    "descripcion": "In Incarnate Forme, Enamorus is a pink, slim humanoid Pokémon, which resembles a genie. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. On its forehead are four sharp magenta horns. Enamorus has white hair tied back, with thick strands shaped like a heart on top of its head, white lips, and two pointed pink ears on either side of its head with a small strand of hair falling in front of them from the temples. Its eyes are yellow with beady white irises and no visible pupils. The front of Enamorus's body is covered in magenta spots, most of them shaped like diamonds, pebbles, and magatamas. Its thin chest consists of two joined diamond-shaped pectorals, its shoulders are adorned with magatama shapes, and on top of its navel is a teardrop, all colored magenta. It has two spotted thin arms, with five fingers on each hand. Its lower body consists of a trailing cloud, with a long, brown tail resembling a snake wrapped twice around its neck. Enamorus's tail has magenta heart markings lined in black running its span, with a pair in place at the end of its tail resembling eyes and another resembling a mouth. Enamorus is known as the \"Herald of Spring\" and \"God of Spring\". The reason is that it arrived from the sea into the Hisui region. This usually signals the end of winter and the rise of the spring season. Enamorus tends to reside in the Crimson Mirelands. It stays in Incarnate Forme when staying in a region. Enamorus's love was said to have given rise to fresh life in the Hisui region. It can unleash mini hearty whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm. Enamorus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Springtide Storm."
