    "pokemon": "Jellicent",
    "pokedex_number": "0593",
    "origin": "Jellicent and its pre-evolved form are most likely based on jellyfish; Jellicent's size and bulbous body may be drawn from the genus Stygiomedusa, also known as the giant phantom jelly, which is large in size and possesses fabric-like tentacles. It also shares traits with the crown jellyfish and jelly blubber. Jellicent's frills and collars seem to be based on typical monarch attire; the male's appearance is based on a king's while the female's is based on a queen's.",
    "description": "Jellicent is a large jellyfish-like Pok√©mon whose appearance varies based on gender. Both genders have five tentacles, two of which are long with petal-shaped ends. The remaining three are short and tapered. A male is blue with a short, white crown, and a white, mustache-like collar. Its eyes are red with blue sclerae, and there is one eyelash over each eye. Its long tentacles have white edges, while its short tentacles have white spots. A female is pink with a tall, white crown and a puffy, white collar. Its eyes are blue with red sclerae and surrounded by two eyelashes. Its mouth is red and heart-shaped. The long tentacles have white edges like the male, but the short ones have white frills. Jellicent can absorb seawater and project it from its head, which lets it move forward in the sea. Jellicent's body composition is similar to seawater. Schools of Jellicent are known to gather for prey during a full moon. Any fancy cruise ships, tankers, or crew that wander into the oceans where it dwells are never found again, and it is rumored that it drags these ships or tankers into the sea and preys on its passengers. It can create lairs from sunken ships. It is known to feed on life energy, where the more it drains, the bigger its crown gets. Jellicent are highly feared by fishers."
