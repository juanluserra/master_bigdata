    "descripcion": "Ledyba is a coleopteran insectoid Pokémon that resembles a ladybug. Its elytra are red with five black spots; this pattern differs slightly for each individual. The wings themselves are transparent. Its main body and lower jaw are yellow, while the rest of its head is red. It has large, round eyes and a pair of black antennae. The antennae are shorter on the female than on the male. It has six black legs with white hands that resemble boxing gloves. Ledyba is a social Pokémon that is active in large groups. If left alone, it becomes timid and afraid to move. It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the Pokémon the Series episode The Whistle Stop, Ledyba is shown to serve a role in pollinating fruit-producing plants and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pokémon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands. Ledyba builds its nest on leaves in temperate forests and jungles and joins with other Ledyba to protect its home when needed. As shown in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, they sleep in groups of four."
