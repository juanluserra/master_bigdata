    "descripcion": "Sirfetch'd is an avian Pokémon that resembles a white duck, standing no taller than its pre-evolved form Farfetch'd and retaining its yellow beak, legs, webbed feet, brown eyes, black eyebrow-like marking, and its stubby tail. It has a crest on its head, consisting of three feathers standing upright. Its wings serve as humanoid hands, with the feathers at the end resembling fingers. It carries a massive leek in two parts, wielding the long, sharpened stalk as a lance and using the hard leaves as a shield. It is said that Sirfetch'd's evolution was attained by Farfetch'd who have experienced and survived many battles. Sirfetch'd is known to be calm and collected, preferring to fight fairly. Due to its noble nature, Sirfetch'd is often chosen as a motif for paintings; one famous painting in the Galar region shows a Sirfetch'd dueling with an Escavalier. The leek it carries is its most prized possession; it is used as both weapon and food, and maintained for many years. Once the leek finally withers, Sirfetch'd will retire from battle for good.[1] Sirfetch'd and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of using the Leek item. Sirfetch'd is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Meteor Assault."
