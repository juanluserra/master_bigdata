    "pokemon": "Bombirdier",
    "pokedex_number": "0962",
    "origin": "Bombirdier appears to be based on a stork, specifically the white stork. In European folklore, white storks are believed to be responsible for delivering babies to new parents by dropping them down chimneys. Bombirdier's design plays with this trope: while its apron and black-and-white plumage bring to mind the image of a nanny, it drops various objects to attack instead.",
    "description": "Bombirdier is a white avian Pokémon resembling a stork. It has black slanted eyes with black eyeliner-like markings around them, a long reddish pink beak with a rounded bump on the tip, and a small fan-like crest on the back of its head. It has a long neck and tall, thin, reddish pink legs, with three toes facing forward and one toe facing backward on each foot. Its claws are black, as are the feathers on the tips of its wings, on its lower body, and on the inside of its tail, which has a squared end. Hanging from Bombirdier's chest is a long white apron made of its own shed feathers, which droops down past its legs. When flying, Bombirdier holds the end of this apron in its beak. It uses the apron to gather food, such as Basculin, and bring them to its nest. Bombirdier also gathers various objects such as rocks in its apron, which it then drops from high places for fun. It particularly enjoys dropping objects that cause loud noises. A giant Bombirdier, known as the Open Sky Titan, is one of the Titan Pokémon found in Paldea. It mainly resides near a mountain in West Province (Area One) where it feeds on Bitter Herba Mystica inside a hidden cave. Bombirdier is the only known Pokémon that can have Rocky Payload as its Ability."
