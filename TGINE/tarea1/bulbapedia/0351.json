    "descripcion": "Castform is an artificial Pokémon that changes appearance and attitude based on the weather. Its body is made of cells exactly like those of water molecules, causing its cellular structure to be chemically altered by temperature and humidity. Though not of its free will, Castform uses this ability to protect its tiny body. In its Normal form, it resembles a plain, gray cloud with a single wisp extending from the top of its head. Regardless of the form it takes, it will always have a large, spherical head and a lighter-colored mask-like marking over its eyes. Various experiments were conducted to change its form in artificial conditions, but all have failed. In Generation III, Weather Ball was its signature move. Despite its man-made origins, it can be found in grassland areas. Castform is the only known Pokémon that can have Forecast as an Ability."
