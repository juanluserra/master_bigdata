    "descripcion": "Braixen is a bipedal, fox-like Pok√©mon. While the majority of its fur is yellow, it has thick black fur on its legs, white arms and face, and a dark orange tail tip. The fur on its cheeks is longer, and a small mane of white fur covers its shoulders and chest. Long, wavy tufts of dark orange fur grow out of its large ears, and its eyes and small nose match this fur in color. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen in its upper jaw. Above its developed legs, the fur around its hips sweeps out to either side, resembling a skirt or shorts. Each paw has three small digits. Braixen always keeps a stick in its tail, which it sets alight using friction from its bushy tail fur. The stick also helps calm down Braixen. The flame from the lit twig is used for both attack and communication. It draws circles in the air with the flame to indicate danger.[1]"
