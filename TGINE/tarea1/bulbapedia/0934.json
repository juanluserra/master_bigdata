    "descripcion": "Garganacl is a large, bipedal Pokémon primarily made up of rock salt and sedimentary rock. Its head has a rugged look and two eyes shaped like right angles. Each of the eyes are orange in color with yellow squares at their centers, and they can glow an orange-red. Garganacl's shoulders comprise tall three-stepped structures made up of blocks of white rock salt, below which its arms connect to. These stepped structures completely cover Garganacl's head from the sides. A taller block of salt is also present behind Garganacl's head. Garganacl's arms and legs are rugged and blocky, and they are similar in appearance and length, with the arms reaching close to the ground due to their location on the body. The upper limbs are dark brown at the base, while the forelimbs are decorated in stripes of lighter brown, before ending in white. Garganacl's hands have three fingers each. Garganacl's torso is really short in comparison to its limbs; it is brown and about as large as its head, with a white block of rock salt on the pelvic area that its legs connect to. Square patches of salt dot the entirety of Garganacl's body. Garganacl's salt is rich in minerals and known to have medicinal properties. Garganacl will scrape its fingertips together to share its salt with injured Pokémon, which can heal them quickly. Many Pokémon gather around Garganacl in hopes to lick up its salt. Garganacl and its pre-evolved form, Naclstack, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Salt Cure. Garganacl and its pre-evolved forms are also the only known Pokémon that can have Purifying Salt as an Ability."
