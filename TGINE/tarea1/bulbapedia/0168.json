    "pokemon": "Ariados",
    "pokedex_number": "0168",
    "origin": "Ariados's appearance seems to be based on the Myrmarachne formicaria spider, but with the prosoma (thorax and head area) and opisthosoma (abdominal area) reversed, fitting with its Pokédex entry. Its ability to spin string from its mouth and its signature move may refer to spitting spiders, which spit venomous silk from their chelicerae to capture prey. Its Sun Pokédex entry and erect, spine-like \"hind legs\" suggest that it may also draw inspiration from various orb-weaver spiders (such as the Jorō spider and arrow-shaped micrathena). The horn on its head may be based on the Ceratogyrus tarantulas, some species of which have similar horns.",
    "description": "Ariados is a red arachnid Pokémon that resembles a spider. It has purple eyes, a pair of white mandibles, and a white horn on its forehead. Around its abdomen are two black stripes and there are two black spots and a yellow spinneret on its rear. The spots and spinneret together form a pattern similar to a face. Ariados can produce thread from both its spinneret and its mouth. It has four yellow legs with two purple bands each; on its back are yellow structures similar to its legs with a single purple stripe each. Its feet are tipped with tiny hooks that allow it to climb ceilings and vertical walls. Ariados makes its nest in the depths of temperate and tropical forests and leaves after dark to hunt prey. Ariados never rest in a specific place while hunting. While Ariados wanders in search of prey, it spins a single thread from its rear that leads back to its nest. When prey is captured, it is wrapped in thread and then attacked by fangs. Ariados then drinks the victim's bodily fluids at leisure. Sometimes, it will instead release prey with only a single thread attached. The thread is then followed to both the caught prey and its friends. Ariados and its pre-evolved form, Spinarak, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Toxic Thread. Before Generation V, Spider Web was its signature move."
