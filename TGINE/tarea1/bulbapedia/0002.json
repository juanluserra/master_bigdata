    "origin": "Ivysaur's evolutionary line is inspired by frogs.[1] In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, and ear-like protrusions on its head make it resemble horned frogs. Of its evolutionary line, Ivysaur was the first to be created, years before Bulbasaur, Venusaur or the concept of evolution was conceived, as it was one of the original monsters created for the Capsule Monsters pitch.[2] Venusaur and Bulbasaur's designs were created afterward; the latter was created by Atsuko Nishida by basing it off of Venusaur.[1]",
    "description": "Ivysaur is a quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process. Ivysaur are typically found in plains."
