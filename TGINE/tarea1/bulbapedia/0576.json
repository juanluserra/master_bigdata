    "pokemon": "Gothitelle",
    "pokedex_number": "0576",
    "origin": "Gothitelle appears to be based on a stylized depiction of a woman wearing Gothic-style clothing and the common trope to associate goth girls with magical powers or witches. Goth styles itself are often borrowed from the punk fashion and can also draw influence from Victorian and Elizabethan fashion periods of the United Kingdom.",
    "description": "Gothitelle is a humanoid Pokémon with a primarily black body. Its head is teardrop-shaped, with a white, bow-like fixture attached to the base of its tip. The black skin on Gothitelle's head opens onto its purple face with a zigzag pattern resembling bangs. Gothitelle has large, heavy-lidded eyes with blue irises and white pupils, as well as a small mouth with red lips. Four flat, black disks flank each side of its head. Gothitelle's body is split into four progressively-larger tiers, with its head and arms being attached to the smallest, uppermost tier and with a pair of stubby pink feet being under them. Its arms are thin, ending in small, purple hands with white disks at the wrists. Each tier of Gothitelle's body has a white, bow-like fixture on its front. Gothitelle's immense psychic power can distort the space around it, showing visions of distant stars and past events, but it dislikes conflict. It can predict the future from the placement and movement of stars and weeps when it discovers the lifespan of its Trainer. It has a detached nature due to seeing how all life will eventually end. A criminal that a Gothitelle had shown his fate to went missing that same day and was never seen again. The visions Gothitelle shares are said to be apparently ethereal and beautiful."
