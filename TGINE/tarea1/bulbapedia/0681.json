    "descripcion": "Aegislash is a Pokémon whose body resembles a golden sword. The edge of the steel blade is white and somewhat serrated near the tip. Where the blade meets the hilt is a single, purple eye with a white slit pupil surrounded by black space. The handle forms a thick, striated spike. Two cloth-like arms emerge from the sides of the hilt. Each arm is primarily black and transitions to a pale purple with a slight swirl pattern at the tip. The sash-like arms split into four tassels at the tips. It always carries an ornate shield in at least one of its arms. The shield is gold and has three brown rings surrounded by black in the middle. It also has a brown rim with three lines radiating toward the center. Aegislash possesses incredible spectral powers, enabling it to manipulate people and Pokémon alike. It is also able to detect the innate qualities of leadership; legend has it that whoever it recognizes as a worthy leader is destined to become king. In fact, this Pokémon has attended and served generations of kings. However, an Aegislash was rumored to have drained the life of one king, causing his kingdom to fall alongside him. Aegislash is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move King's Shield."
