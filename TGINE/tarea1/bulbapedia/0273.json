    "description": "Seedot is a small, brown plant Pokémon that resembles an acorn. A beige, mask-like pattern covers its large black eyes, and it has two beige feet. It has a gray \"cap\" with a short stem on top of its head. The stem is used to hang from tree branches in its forest home. While hanging, this Pokémon absorbs moisture and nutrients from the tree until it becomes too heavy and falls to the ground. The more it drinks, the glossier its body becomes. Additionally, Seedot polishes itself with leaves once daily. If it remains still, it can be mistaken for a nut and startles others by moving suddenly. It also uses this strategy to be taken by bird Pokémon to expand on its habitat."
