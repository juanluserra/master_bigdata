    "descripcion": "Charmeleon is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has dark red scales and a cream underside from the chest down. It has blue eyes and a long snout with a slightly hooked tip. On the back of its head is a single horn-like protrusion. It has relatively long arms with three sharp claws. Its short legs have plantigrade feet with three claws and cream-colored soles. The tip of its long, powerful tail has a flame burning on it. The temperature rises to unbearable levels if Charmeleon swings its tail. Charmeleon has a vicious, hotheaded nature and will constantly seek out opponents. Strong opponents excite this Pokémon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that torch its surroundings. Charmeleon enjoys tormenting the opponents it fights. However, it will relax once it has won a battle. It is rare in the wild but can be found in mountainous areas. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charmleon is known to sleep with a laid-back posture, using its hands as a pillow.[1] Its fierce fervor disappears when it sleeps."
