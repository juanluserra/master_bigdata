    "descripcion": "Virizion is a stag or antelope-like, quadrupedal Pokémon that is primarily green. On the sides of its head are long horns that end in dull, curled points. It has a pointed snout with a black blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. Its face, hind legs, and underside are white. There is a pinked-tipped leaf on each side of its neck, and leafy tufts on its shoulders. On its back, there are pointed tufts of fur forming a medium-long tail. Its lower legs resemble knee-high boots with pink highlights at the knees, and it has black hooves. According to legend, Virizion, alongside the other Swords of Justice had challenged the humans in order to protect other Pokémon from losing their homes to the humans's expansion. During the battle, Virizion used its speed to shield the other Pokémon from sparks and embers. The three Swords distrust humans because of a war that resulted in a forest fire in Moor of Icirrus. Virizion attacks its opponents by first darting around them with whirlwind-like speed, before using its sharp, sword-like horns to swiftly cut them down. In Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, Virizion is depicted as the most intelligent member of the Swords of Justice. As seen in both Pokémon the Series and Pokémon Adventures, it can create an energy blade out of its head. Virizion loves Virizion Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and talked to it in the past. Iron Leaves shares a resemblance to Virizion and is believed to be a futuristic Virizion. In Generation V, Sacred Sword was its signature move."
