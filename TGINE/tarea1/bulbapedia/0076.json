    "descripcion": "Golem is a bipedal tortoise-like boulder Pokémon with a spherical body covered by a shell of plated, green rocks. Its body is so hard that even dynamite cannot scratch it. Its head protrudes from the center of the shell. The head has a flat snout with two pointed teeth in the lower jaw and red eyes. It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown. Golem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards, Golem's shell is hollow, despite it looking like it is not. As shown in The Bridge Bike Gang, Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.[1] It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps."
