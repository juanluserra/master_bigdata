    "origin": "Staravia seems to be based on an adult starling. However, its features seem to be based more on an adult northern lapwing.",
    "description": "Staravia is a grayish-brown, avian Pokémon with black and white markings. Its head and upper body are primarily black with an \"M\"-shaped pattern over its white chest. On its forehead is a grayish-brown spot, which is smaller on the female. On its face is a white, mask-like marking with a pattern of spikes along the lower edge. It has small, black eyes with white pupils and a long, orange beak with a black tip. On the back of its head is a long tuft of feathers, which curves forward. The lower halves of its wings are black, and it has black tail feathers with a single white feather in the center. Its orange, anisodactyl feet have black talons. Staravia lives near forests and fields, where it hunts for Bug Pokémon. Aware of its own weakness, it forms flocks of its own kind and cries noisily if left on its own. However, these flocks can be extremely territorial. When two different groups meet, they will have fierce territorial disputes. A strong Staravia can be identified by the plume it has on its head."
