    "descripcion": "Dratini is a reptilian Pokémon with a blue serpentine body and a white underside. It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes. Dratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the \"Mirage Pokémon\", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was.[1] However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called Coiled Sleep, Wriggly Sleep, Uncoiled Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. In Generation II, Dratini and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
