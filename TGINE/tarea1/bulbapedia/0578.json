    "pokemon": "Duosion",
    "pokedex_number": "0578",
    "origin": "Duosion and the rest of its evolutionary line seem to bear reference to cells, with the green substance surrounding their bodies resembling cytoplasm and the objects inside their bodies representing organelles. The line down its head also resembles a cleavage furrow due to mitosis. It may also make allusion to the embryonary stages, specifically when the embryo is fully developed to become into a fetus, while the green jelly may represent the amniotic fluid.",
    "description": "Duosion is a pale green Pokémon with a large head, stubby arms, and a body that tapers to a point at the bottom. It has oval, black eyes, and a red, diamond-shaped mouth. It is encased in a darker green, gelatinous substance that forms small, round bumps on the lower sides and over Duosion's head. A small circular piece of matter floats inside this substance over this Pokémon's head. It has two brains, which think independently, causing it to attempt two different actions at once. However, when its brains think alike, it exhibits greater psychic powers, which are said to be able to travel half a mile away."
