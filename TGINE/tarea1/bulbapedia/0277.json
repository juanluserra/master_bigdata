    "pokemon": "Swellow",
    "pokedex_number": "0277",
    "origin": "Swellow seems to be based on a swallow, specifically the barn swallow or welcome swallow. Its colors and crest are also similar to those of a treeswift. Its predatory behavior and speedy flight may be based on falcons or the swallow-tailed kite. Its Shiny colors and long tail feathers resemble those of the resplendent quetzal, and said Shiny coloration may have been inspired by the violet-green swallow.",
    "description": "Swellow is a large, dark-blue avian Pok√©mon with a red breast and face. A crest of feathers sweeps back from the top of its head. A blue stripe separates the red markings on its head and chest, and it has a white underside. It has small, narrow eyes, a pointed, yellow beak, and red feet with black talons. Each foot has three forward-facing toes and one pointed backward. Two long, pointed feathers with red tips form its tail and are an indication of good health when standing up straight. Swellow's wings taper to a sharp point. An impressive dive-bomber, it will never miss its target. Additionally, it takes great pride in its glossy plumage and often cleans the wings of other Swellow. It searches for warm meadows while in the air. Swellow preys on Wurmple."
