    "descripcion": "Nidorino is a light-purple, quadrupedal mammalian Pok√©mon. It has several darker purple patches across its body. It has large, spiny ears with teal insides, narrow black eyes, and a long snout with two pointed teeth protruding from the upper jaw. Nidorino has a ridge of toxic spines on its back and a long, pointed horn on its forehead. The horn is harder than a diamond and can secrete poison on impact. The more adrenaline Nidorino has in its body, the more potent the poison is. Its short legs have three claws on each foot. Nidorino is a male-only species. Nidorino is independent, nervous, and fierce, often described as violent and easily angered. It uses its ears to check its surroundings. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might. Nidorino's harder-than-diamond horn can destroy diamonds, and it uses that horn to destroy boulders in its search for Moon Stones. Nidorino live in hot savannas and plains."
