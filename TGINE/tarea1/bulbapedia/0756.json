    "pokemon": "Shiinotic",
    "pokedex_number": "0756",
    "origin": "Shiinotic may be based on bioluminescent mushrooms such as those of the genus Mycena. It also features a volval sac and wide-brimmed warty cap, which are trademarks of the Amanita family. Its Fairy type may be due to the fact that both families are known to grow in fairy rings, or it may possibly be a reference to fairy fire. From its name, Shiinotic may have some aspects of the shiitake mushroom as well.",
    "description": "Shiinotic is a Pokémon that resembles a large mushroom. It has a slim, white body, similar to a stalk, and a large purple mushroom cap on its head. It has black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides and a thick, black mouth. The ends of its long, thin arms split into three pale green filaments that act as fingers. The lower part of its body and stubby feet are covered in a fluffy pink substance. The mushroom cap on its head has a fluffy pink rim, pale green bumps on top, and a pale green, gilled underside. This Pokémon lives in dark forests and competes with Parasect over territory; their fights often leave the area coated in spores. In the Pokémon the Series episode Lulled to La-La Land!, Shiinotic has been shown illuminating the spot and gills on its mushroom. This strange light can confuse people who enter its habitat, causing them to lose their way. Additionally, the flickering spore it releases can cause drowsiness. It takes advantage of sleeping prey by sucking their energy through the tips of its arms. It can also transmit energy to whomever it likes, be it human, Pokémon, or vegetation, through the same method. In Generation VII, Strength Sap was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
