    "descripcion": "Sinistcha is a Pokémon made of matcha tea. As such, its main body is entirely green, except for its mouth and swirly eyes, which are yellow in color. Its arms are thin and its hands have three digits, and it has two small legs. It inhabits a 茶碗 chawan, a tea bowl used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The chawan it inhabits is black and white, with a few cracks sealed with green all over it, and a swirling, face-like pattern on its side. Atop its head, Sinistcha wears a 茶筅 chasen (a bamboo whisk used to prepare and stir matcha tea)[1], which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, Sinistcha is not biologically related to Polteageist. Sinistcha lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, Sinistcha would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force. However, because the chawan Sinistcha inhabits had fallen out of use, this act became largely unsuccessful. In recent times, instead of sneaking into houses, Sinistcha roams towns and suburbs in search of prey. It is generally active after sunset, and will attack anything that approaches it with a life-force-draining splash of tea. In order to prepare itself for battle, Sinistcha builds up its energy by using the chasen on its head to stir itself.[1] Sinistcha is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Matcha Gotcha. Additionally, Sinistcha and its pre-evolved form, Poltchageist, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability."
