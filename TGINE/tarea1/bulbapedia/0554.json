    "descripcion": "Darumaka is a round, red Pokémon with short arms and legs and a stubby tail. It has an orange face and curly yellow eyebrows. It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its hands and feet are orange with three digits each. Darumaka has a flame inside its body. While this flame is burning, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep; at rest, its internal temperature is about 1,100 °F (600 °C). It tucks in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which it resembles in this state. Darumaka is well known as a symbol of good luck. It is also known to have very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm. It prefers to live in a desert environment."
