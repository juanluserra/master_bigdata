    "pokemon": "Blissey",
    "pokedex_number": "0242",
    "origin": "Blissey appears to be based on a nurse, specifically sharing some physical similarities with Nurse Joy from the animated series in both color and hair. Its tendency to carry eggs in a pouch is much like a monotreme (mainly the echidna) or a marsupial, but may also simply be based on a general concept of females and motherhood. Its names suggest it may be based on literal happiness.",
    "description": "Blissey is a Pokémon that has a large, ovoid body with a pink upper body and white lower body. It has hair-like curls on either side of its head. White, wing-like tufts grow from its hips and shoulders, creating the impression of a dress. Its stubby arms and feet are pink and lack any digits. A small, pink pouch on its belly holds a single egg, which brings feelings of happiness and makes a person pleasant and caring if ingested. The egg can cause a person to start acting kindly to others and calm down even the most ferocious Pokémon. Eating a Blissey's egg is said to bring good fortune to those who have consumed it. Blissey's egg can fetch the highest price at markets. Blissey can use its fluffy fur to sense sadness and will rush to anyone feeling sad or ill and attempt to nurse them back to health. Blissey is said to be overflowing with love. Blissey is a female-only species with no male counterpart. An urban Pokémon, it is rarely seen in the wild. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, if the player is injured, any nearby Blissey will approach the player and will wait nearby, only fleeing after the player has recovered to full health.[1] Blissey and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Soft-Boiled by leveling up."
