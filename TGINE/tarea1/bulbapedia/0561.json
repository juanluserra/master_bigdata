    "pokemon": "Sigilyph",
    "pokedex_number": "0561",
    "origin": "Sigilyph appears to have been inspired by the Nazca Lines, specifically the avian figures, and kachina dolls. Like Sigilyph, the Nazca Lines are found in a desert. It also resembles a wind chime or a totem pole; the latter of which is found throughout the United States and Canada.",
    "description": "Sigilyph is a multicolored, totem pole-like Pok√©mon, possessing a single cyan eye on its black head, as well as two similar-looking eyespots (distinguishable as such because they never blink) on its body. Its base is mostly black, with a green zigzag pattern in the middle and a black pattern surrounded by green. Sigilyph has a pair of wings and a long tail-like appendage that are yellow with blue and red stripes on each of the \"feathers\". It has two black \"feet\" with three toes each and two small spikes at its base. Sigilyph's psychic powers grant it the ability to levitate constantly. Sigilyph will use its psychic powers to attack anyone who invades its territory. Due to it retaining memories from when it guarded an ancient city or served as the guardians' emissaries, it apparently flies along the same route constantly. Sigilyph lives in deserts and rocky environments."
