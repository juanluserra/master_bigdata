    "pokemon": "Eelektross",
    "pokedex_number": "0604",
    "origin": "Eelektross and its pre-evolved forms are based on eels,[1] perhaps specifically the electric eel (which is actually a type of knifefish, despite its name). They may also be based on leeches.",
    "description": "Eelektross is an eel-like Pok√©mon that resembles a lamprey, with a long tentacle-like, finned limb extending from its head. It has red eyes, a dark blue body, and possesses clawed, paddle-like arms with yellow spots and yellow-and-red palms. It has a beige fin on the upper portion of its body and beige fin-like legs below. It lives in the ocean, but it crawls ashore using its arms in order to hunt. It latches onto prey with its sucker mouth and shocks them with electricity from its fangs, before dragging them as it returns into the ocean."
