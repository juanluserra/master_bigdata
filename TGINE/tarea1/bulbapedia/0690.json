    "descripcion": "Skrelp is a brown aquatic Pok√©mon that resembles a common sea dragon. It has a purple face and neck, red eyes rimmed with black, a tubular, upturned snout, a leaf-like pectoral fin on either side of its head, and a large, roundish lump on top of its head. A light blue, round growth is attached to the back of its head by a thin brown stem. Its back has a slight hunch with a blunt spike. On either side of its body is a rounded, light blue fin and it has a striated, purple belly. Its tail is composed of three leaf-like fins. Skrelp is a poor swimmer, and gets easily washed away by storms. Skrelp rides seaweed as a form of traveling the ocean. It camouflages itself as the seaweed to hide from enemies while storing power for evolution. It also uses this technique to hide from prey, which it sprays with liquid poison when approached. However, its main source of food is rotten seaweed, which it uses to create its poison. Skrelp is known to coexist well with Dhelmise."
