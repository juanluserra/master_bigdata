    "pokemon": "Doduo",
    "pokedex_number": "0084",
    "origin": "Despite its name, Doduo seems like it has more in common with ostriches than dodos. It also seems to show some similarities to the moa, an extinct flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand; and the emu, another flightless bird. It also resembles the kiwi in some ways as well. According to Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, Doduo was discovered 3 years prior to the original games and is believed that its double head is a recent mutation.",
    "description": "Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pok√©mon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes. It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync. Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs."
