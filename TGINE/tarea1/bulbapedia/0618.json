    "descripcion": "Stunfisk is a flat, fishlike Pok√©mon with a broad, mud-brown body. At the base of its yellow tail is a yellow marking shaped like an exclamation mark when seen from behind. These markings can generate electricity. It has small, horizontal, oval-shaped eyes, white with a tiny black pupil and no irises. Almost exactly between these two eyes lies the two thick gray lips that form its mouth. It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they're wings to remain airborne. Stunfisk lives in mudflats and coastal areas, and thanks to the bacteria which lived alongside it, it developed the organs which it uses to generate electricity. Stunfisk's very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in the mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touches a Stunfisk's body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes for a reason that is still not yet known. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away."
