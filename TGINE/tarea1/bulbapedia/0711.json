    "pokemon": "Gourgeist",
    "pokedex_number": "0711",
    "origin": "Gourgeist appears to be based on bottle gourds, pumpkins, and modern jack-o'-lanterns, decorations made out of carved pumpkins for Halloween. Its multiple sizes may be a reference to the tradition of trying to grow the largest pumpkin for Halloween. Its upper body may also be based on the candles within jack-o'-lanterns themselves, with the curl being its wick and its hair-like extensions its dripping wax. It could also be viewed as a mere extension of the shape and the curl on top being its stem. The lower body's different color might also reference the tradition of decorating gourds with paint. Gourgeist's behavior of knocking on people's front doors before whisking them away, as described by its Pokédex entry in Pokémon Shield, may reference the Halloween tradition of going door-to-door for trick-or-treating.",
    "description": "Gourgeist is a ghostly gourd-like Pokémon that varies dramatically in size. Its body is a dark brown pumpkin with a glowing, yellow-orange face carved into the front and a pair of nubby legs. The face consists of two triangular eyes and a grinning mouth; on top of the mouth is a small, triangular cutout for a nose. Poking out of the top of the pumpkin is its slender brown-orange head, which has bright yellow eyes and a small mouth but no visible nose. Gourgeist has long, light pink hair with arm-like tendrils framing its face and bangs that usually cover one eye. On top of its head is a crescent-shaped tuft that is brown on top; this tuft resembles a pumpkin's stem. In the animated series, Gourgeist has shown the ability to retract its upper body into the pumpkin, giving it the appearance of a traditional jack-o'-lantern. On the night of a new moon, Gourgeist wanders town streets while singing an eerie song. Those who hear its song will be cursed. It is also known to sing joyfully while observing prey it has entangled in its arms. Gourgeist and its pre-evolved form Pumpkaboo are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Trick-or-Treat."
