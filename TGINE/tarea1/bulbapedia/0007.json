    "descripcion": "Squirtle is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles a light-blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves. Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. In the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell.[1]  It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. In Generation II, Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
