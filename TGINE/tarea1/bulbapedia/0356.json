    "descripcion": "Dusclops is a Pokémon with a roundish gray body with two stubby legs. Its body is hollow and wrapped in bandages. It has a single red eye and three tooth-like projections. The red eye is said to be the true form of Dusclops, but no one has yet to see this claim. It has two wispy, light gray growths coming out of its shoulders and one on top of its head. Its light gray hands are almost always depicted as being directly attached to its body, though in PK15 and in several panels of Pokémon Adventures they can be seen floating independently. Its body can absorb anything much like a black hole, pulling through the gaps between the bandages and wrapping it. It is unknown what happens when something is absorbed in Dusclops, as nothing ever comes back out. It will wave its hands and eyes to hypnotize opponents and then force them to do as it desires. Dusclops preys on drifting will-o'-the-wisps, sucking them into its body. It usually lives in thick forests and is generally active during nighttime."
