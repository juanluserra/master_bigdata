    "pokedex_number": "0595",
    "origin": "Joltik's name, appearance, and its Pokédex entries stating that it latches onto larger Pokémon to drain their static electricity, all suggest that it may be based on a tick. It may also be based on a jumping spider or, like its evolved form, a tarantula.",
    "description": "Joltik is a tiny arachnid Pokémon. It has four legs tipped with blue, conical feet. Its ovoid body is completely covered in yellow fur, with notable tufts sticking out on each side of its face, just over each eye, and its lower back. Joltik has four blue eyes. The two larger eyes are set relatively far apart on its face, containing black pupils. The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees. At 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokémon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!, Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave!, it's shown that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger. Joltik mainly lives in caves and cities with electricity."
