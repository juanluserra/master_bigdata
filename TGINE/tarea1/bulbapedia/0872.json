    "descripcion": "Snom is a small, larval Pokémon. Most of its round white body is covered by a translucent shell of icy spikes. Its exposed head features two black eyes and round mouthparts.  Four short legs are located underneath its body. Snom anchors itself to branches with frigid thread it extrudes from its mouth to disguise itself as an icicle while sleeping. Snom consumes snow that has piled up on the ground, and prefers soft, fresh snow; it will climb its way up a mountain eating through its snow. Snom's internal organs amplify the cold air from the snow it consumes, which it uses to create the spikes on its back. The more snow it eats, the larger and more impressive the spikes grow. As shown in Pokémon Camp, Snom are known to be voracious eaters, only being satisfied with heaping amounts of food. If it is startled, it will quickly burrow into the snow. Snom and its evolution, Frosmoth, are the only known Pokémon that can have Ice Scales as an Ability."
