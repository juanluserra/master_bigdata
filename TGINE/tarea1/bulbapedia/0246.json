    "descripcion": "Larvitar is a small, green reptilian Pokémon with rocky skin. It has a blunt spike on top of its head, a short, rounded snout, and triangular, black markings below and on the upper corners of its red eyes. Red scales cover its diamond-shaped belly, and there are several small diamond-shaped holes in its body. Its short arms lack fingers, while its feet have a single toenail each. It has a tail with a conical center surrounded by a ring of plate-like scales, causing it to resemble a tunnel-boring machine. Larvitar is born deep underground, far from its parent. It emerges to the surface and grows by consuming soil, and it will enter its pupal stage upon eating an entire mountain's worth of earth. This pupal stage is an evolution called Pupitar. Larvitar usually lives in mountains, hills, and caves. It adapts poorly to bright lights. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is possible to find a Larvitar holding a half-eaten clump of earth while it sleeps.[1] It is believed this is due to Larvitar falling asleep after filling its belly."
