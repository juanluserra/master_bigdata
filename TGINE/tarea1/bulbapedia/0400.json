    "description": "Bibarel is a bulky, bipedal Pokémon similar to a beaver. Brown fur covers most of this Pokémon, with a tan bib-like pattern on its chest. Its face is covered by a tan mask with a rounded extension over each eye; the male will have an additional extension to the side of each eye. While its forepaws are small and slightly webbed, its hind paws are larger and more rounded. Both sets of paws are black with three toes, but the hind paws have circular, tan paw pads. Bibarel's large, flat tail is black with a tan, wavy marking near the tip. Rounded tufts of fur line each side of its face. Its short, dark brown snout has a small red nose and protruding upper incisors. These teeth are used for chewing trees. This Pokémon is known to be an industrious worker. It builds its nest by damming rivers, using bark, roots, and branches it has cut up with its teeth, along with mud. A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow. Bibarel is slow-moving and awkward out of the water, but is a swift swimmer, comparable to a Feebas. Bibarel's fur is very good at repelling water and retaining heat. Prior to Generation V, Bibarel and its pre-evolved form, Bidoof, were the only known Pokémon that could have Unaware as an Ability."
