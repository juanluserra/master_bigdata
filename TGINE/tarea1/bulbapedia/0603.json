    "descripcion": "Eelektrik is a blue-black, eel-like Pok√©mon with a beige underbelly. Its round, toothy, leech-like mouth has red lips, and its eyes have small pupils with yellow circle patterning around them. Beige fins extend from above and below its head, and its body has three yellow circular electricity-generating organs on either side. It has a red tail fin that resembles a fan. Eelektrik is a vigorous carnivore and has a good appetite. Upon spotting prey, it immediately coils around it and shocks it using its electricity-generating organs to paralyze it, before eating it. It dwells in caves and marine environments."
