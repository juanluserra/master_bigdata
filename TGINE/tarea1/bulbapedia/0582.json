    "descripcion": "Vanillite is a small Pokémon with a head covered in snow, overall resembling soft-serve vanilla ice cream in a cup or wafer cone. Beneath this lies its actual head, which is made of the same icy material as its body. It has dark blue eyes, a dark-blue mouth, and light blue crystals on its cheeks. Its small body is adorned with specks of ice and has stubby arms. The snow on a Vanillite's head can melt with heat or repeated touching, leaving its head exposed. If seen in this state, Vanillite become embarrassed. Vanillite are born from icicles that are hit by morning sunlight and wish not to melt. It can blow winds with temperatures as low as −58 °F (−50 °C), which causes it to create ice crystals and make it snow in nearby areas when it exhales. It sleeps buried under snow and gains energy from the morning sun. In hotter regions, it is treasured by households, though it shrinks little by little. Glalie is a natural predator of Vanillite."
