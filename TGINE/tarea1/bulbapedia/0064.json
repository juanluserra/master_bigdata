    "pokemon": "Kadabra",
    "pokedex_number": "0064",
    "origin": "Kadabra appears to be based on magicians and spoon benders. It also shares similarities with foxes, animals mythologically tied to magic. Its mustache-like tufts of fur may be an exaggeration of a fox's whiskers. The symbols on Kadabra's forehead and abdomen appear to be references to Zener cards, a small deck of symbols used in experiments to test for extrasensory perception and clairvoyance in the early 1930s. As it created its spoon with its psychic powers, it may be based on the practise of alchemy, an early science that sought to synthesise metals with magic. The \"Transformation\" novel about Kadabra may be based on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis or the Ultra Q episode \"Kanegon's Cocoon\", where a young boy transformed into a strange yellow monster.",
    "description": "Kadabra is a primarily yellow, slightly humanoid Pokémon with mammalian features. It has two long, pointed ears on top of its head, a red star on its forehead, narrow, deep-set eyes, and wide cheeks leading down to a thin snout. Extending from each side of its snout are two mustache-like tufts of fur; a male will have a longer mustache than a female. Kadabra's torso is segmented with bulky shoulders, a thick, brown chest, and a small abdomen marked by three red, wavy lines. Attached to the Pokémon's abdomen is a large, thick tail encircled with a brown band near its base. Its arms are thin with brown elbows and end in three-fingered hands with white claws. Its legs have prominent knees and large, three-toed feet, also ending in white claws. Two of its toes face forward and one backward. Kadabra is always seen carrying a silver spoon, which amplifies its telekinetic powers. A gold spoon does not work as an amplifier and Kadabra is only half as strong without a spoon. Kadabra emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backward, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. It sleeps while levitating, using its springy tail like a pillow. It can store up psychic energy inside its star in preparation for its evolution. There is a theory that Kadabra was born from a transformed human child who could not control his powers. Kadabra lives in urban areas. Kadabra and its evolved form, Alakazam, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Kinesis."
