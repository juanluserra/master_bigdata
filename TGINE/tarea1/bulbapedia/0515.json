    "pokemon": "Panpour",
    "pokedex_number": "0515",
    "origin": "Panpour is based on a monkey,[1] with the top of its head resembling a fountain, a geyser, or a water spout. It may also be a visual pun on Sea-Monkeys.",
    "description": "Panpour is a simian, blue-and-cream Pok√©mon. It has oval eyes that are usually seen closed, large ears with light blue insides, and a tiny, black nose. There is a puffy, wave-like crest on top of its head. Nutrient-rich water is stored in this crest. It also possesses a blue, frilled-like feature on its neck and upper shoulders. Its muzzle, lower body, and skinny forelimbs are cream-colored, and its hands seem to have no fingers, aside from a thumb. Its small feet both have three toes each. Its long tail has a clover-shaped tip. Panpour can keep itself damp or water plants by spraying water from its tail. It is mostly found near water sources."
