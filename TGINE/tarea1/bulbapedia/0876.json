    "descripcion": "Indeedee is a dark purple and white bipedal Pokémon that differs in appearance depending on their gender. Both forms have white faces, rounded heads and pear-shaped bodies, and white hands and feet with three digits on each of them. The males have upward-turned spiral horns, blue markings in-between their eyes, a generally more navy body, and more white around the legs. Females have downward-turned spiral horns, pink markings above their eyes, a white body, and darker legs. These markings all give them the appearance of butlers and maids. These Pokémon willingly serve people and other Pokémon, as they derive energy from feelings of gratitude. They sense emotions by touching their horns to determine other's needs and serve them better. Males are skilled at being valets while the females are supposed to be excellent babysitters. Indeedee is always bustling around, searching and serving those with happy feelings. The Indeedee never leaves its Trainer's side. It uses its psychic power to predict its Trainer's actions and take care of everyday needs. Indeedee dislikes conflict and will throw things at anyone who disturbs its territory using its psychic powers. In Generation IX, Indeedee is the only known Pokémon that can have Psychic Surge as an Ability."
