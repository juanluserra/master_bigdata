    "descripcion": "Honchkrow is a dark-blue avian Pok√©mon with plumage resembling a person dressed in formal attire, one that most resembles a mob boss. It has a large feather crest resembling a fedora hat that has spikes extending from the back. It has circular red eyes with white sclerae and dark blue eyelids. Its yellow beak is slightly curved, and its head is supported by a broad, short neck. Honchkrow has a white and prominent crest of feathers on its chest that bears resemblance to a beard or cravat. Its wings have red feathers on the inside. Honchkrow has black feet with four toes. The tail's base is a white, cylindrical stalk, on which there is a growth of red feathers on the end. Honchkrow is known to be ruthless. With a mere cry, it can summon and organize a murder of more than one hundred Murkrow to collect food for it. Honchkrow also summons Murkrow to fight on its behalf, letting them do most of the fighting before it deals the finishing blow. The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving Honchkrow the moniker, \"Summoner of Night.\" Honchkrow will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so. Honchkrow is more active at night, and normally spends the daytime hours tending to its feathers in solitude. It is a scavenger that lives in swamps, forests, human towns and cities, and plains."
