    "pokemon": "Empoleon",
    "pokedex_number": "0395",
    "origin": "Empoleon appears to be based on an emperor penguin and an emperor, about its royal appearance. Based on its names in various languages, Empoleon may specifically take inspiration from Napoleon Bonaparte, an emperor of France. Empoleon's beak has the appearance of both a crown and a trident, a fishing tool and the weapon of choice for the Greek god of the sea, Poseidon. Empoleon also bears some resemblance to the royal penguin. Its ability to cut through ice with its sharp wings could be a reference to an icebreaker.",
    "description": "Empoleon is a large, navy-blue, penguin-like Pokémon. It has a wide, yellow beak that extends upward into three pointed horns that form a trident-shaped crest bracketing blue eyes. Large horns are a symbol of leadership and strength for Empoleon. There is a blue marking resembling a crown over its eyes and a white, lacy marking running down its chest. A blue, fin-like projection forms a collar around its throat and runs down the length of its chest and belly. On its back are two raised, gold bumps and a second blue fin that forms its tail. Its yellow feet are webbed with three toes each and its feathers form ruffs above its feet. It has wide, flipper-like wings rimmed with blue along the tips, and three golden claws. The edges of these wings are comparable to master-crafted blades, capable of slicing through ice floes, and this Pokémon will use them to attack anyone or anything that damages its pride. However, it prefers to avoid unnecessary disputes at times. When swimming in the water, Empoleon can move as fast as a jet boat. In Hisui, people have revered Empoleon since ancient times, referring to it as the Master of the Waves."
