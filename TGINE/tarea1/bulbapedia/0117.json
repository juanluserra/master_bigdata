    "pokemon": "Seadra",
    "pokedex_number": "0117",
    "origin": "Seadra seems to be based on a seahorse, possibly the spiny seahorse. Its category may be a reference to the Japanese word for seahorse, 竜の落とし子 tatsu-no-otoshigo (literally \"illegitimate child of a dragon\"), which is derived from the myth that a seahorse that lives for a century will transform into a dragon. Its spiky, poisonous fins are reminiscent of a lionfish, its ability to shoot ink is reminiscent of a squid, and the shape of its snout and Sniper Ability are reminiscent of a water gun.",
    "description": "Seadra is a light blue, piscine Pokémon that is similar to a seahorse with a cream-colored belly covered in rough scales. It has a long, tubular mouth, narrow, black eyes, a fin-like ridge above each eye, and spiny pectoral fins. It also has a large, coiled tail. It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce numbness and even fainting in humans, but it is still prized among practitioners of traditional medicine. Seadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest. During this time, the male's venom also becomes thicker and stronger than usual."
