    "pokemon": "Oricorio",
    "pokedex_number": "0741",
    "origin": "Oricorio may be inspired by Hawaiian honeycreepers, small passerine birds native to Hawaii. Hawaiian honeycreepers feed on the nectar of various plants, but each species favors a specific flower that its beak is adapted to. Its dancing may also derive from the mating dances of some birds.",
    "description": "Oricorio is an avian Pokémon that can change between four markedly different forms. The form it takes depends on the kind of nectar it consumes. All forms have a light pink beak, thin legs, and dark eyes with white pupils. The feet have three toes in front and one in back, and the beak curves downward. Oricorio is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Revelation Dance, which changes its type according to Oricorio's style. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Dancer as an Ability."
