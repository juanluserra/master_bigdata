    "descripcion": "Goodra is a bipedal, draconic Pokémon that is coated with slime. Most of its body is pale purple with a darker purple underside. It has bright green eyes, two green spots on each cheek, a relatively long neck, and a short, rounded snout. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns. The foremost horns are small nubs, but the hind horns are longer, thicker, and curve down its neck. The tips of the larger horns are slightly curled. It has proportionally short limbs with two digits each and a large, thick tail with a curled tip. Along each side of its tail are three green spots. A pale green slime is usually visible dripping from its chin and arms. It is known for having a great affinity for water, being able to live within water with no difficulty at all, as well as dive and surf all around the area. Because of its meek, friendly nature, Goodra is often teased for supposed weakness. Goodra is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. Goodra usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. Goodra can become uncontrollable once enraged. The horns can hit 100 times harder than the blow of a heavyweight boxer. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. Goodra lives in plains and mountains, usually during rainy days. Prior to Generation IX, Goodra and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability."
