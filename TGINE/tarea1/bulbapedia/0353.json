    "pokemon": "Shuppet",
    "pokedex_number": "0353",
    "origin": "Shuppet appears to be based on a てるてる坊主 teru teru bōzu, a Japanese paper doll resembling a ghost. It also resembles a hand puppet. It also appears similar to common depictions of ghosts, specifically those that resemble floating cloths with faces.",
    "description": "Shuppet is a spherical, levitating Pokémon that appears to be covered by a gray cloth. Black rings surround its multicolored eyes, which have light-blue sclerae, dark-blue irises, and yellow pupils. Occasionally, it will display a large, pink tongue. Extending from the top of its head is a long, pointed horn. The horn collects the negative emotions of people, on which this Pokémon feeds. The emotions it feeds on include anger, jealousy, resentment, and malice, so some people are grateful for its presence. This also helps Shuppet become slowly stronger. A nocturnal Pokémon, Shuppet will appear in swarms beneath the eaves of houses with negative people. As such, there exists a proverb that says, “Shun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk”. It is most commonly found in cities and other urban settings and will retreat to the nest in which it lives when the sun rises. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, a Shuppet sleeping near the sleeping person will eat up their dark feelings. As a result, the person will wake up in the morning with their mood improved."
