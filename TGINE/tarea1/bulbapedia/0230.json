    "pokemon": "Kingdra",
    "pokedex_number": "0230",
    "origin": "Kingdra seems to be based on a seahorse, possibly the crowned seahorse, with some seadragon (genera Phyllopteryx and Phycodurus) elements. Its Dragon type and category may be a reference to the Japanese word for seahorse, 竜の落とし子 tatsu-no-otoshigo (literally \"illegitimate child of a dragon\"), which is derived from the myth that a seahorse that lives for a century will transform into a dragon, as well as the aforementioned seadragons.",
    "description": "Kingdra is a large, piscine Pokémon that is similar to a seahorse with a tightly curled tail. It is covered in blue scales except for its yellow, compact belly scales. There are thin spines with a single branch atop its head and thin, white fins under its cheeks. Its thin snout is powerful, allowing squirts of water jets with devastating power to be fired. Two-pronged fins extend slightly past its cheeks. On its back is a white fin supported by thin, blue spines similar to the ones on its head. The yawn of a sleeping Kingdra is powerful enough to create undercurrents capable of destroying small ships. Should it decide to emerge from the depths of the ocean, Kingdra's strength can create large whirlpools and waterspouts on the surface. Because of its immense power, Kingdra often hibernates deep in uninhabited areas of the sea to build up its energy, usually at the bottom of the seas. When a storm arrives, Kingdra is said to awaken and wander about in search of prey. Kingdra's awakening can cause tornadoes. It is known to have fierce battles with Dragonite whenever they meet. Kingdra's gleaming scales are gifted to royals."
