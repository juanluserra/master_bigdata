    "descripcion": "Claydol is a large, black Pok√©mon that resembles a mud statue with two stubby legs. It has a rounded, oblate-shaped head with a peg-like protrusion extending from the center of the top of its head. Along the circumference of its head are many round, pink eye-like structures alternating with yellow studs or beak-like protrusions between each \"eye\". An undulating, white rim runs along the upper edges of the eyes. Its torso features white ring markings, each with a downward extension and yellow dot in the middle. Two smaller orbs sit at its sides like limbs and a peg-like protrusion extends from each orb that is capable of firing various energy beams. These two orbs are not attached to its body but are usually kept floating close by Claydol's psychic powers. Claydol uses the same telekinetic abilities to move and float through the air. It lives in rough terrains. Claydol has a body that is prone to melting when wet and uses its psychic powers to protect itself from rain. It was said to have started its life as an ancient clay figure created 20,000 years ago by ancient people, who apparently modeled it after something that descended from the sky."
