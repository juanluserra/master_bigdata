    "origin": "Wiglett appears to be based on garden eels, and may also draw inspiration from razor clams and tubifex worms. The fact that it physically resembles Diglett may be a reference to convergent evolution or parallel evolution, which can lead to separate organisms independently developing similar or identical characteristics and body plans. Its simplistic anatomy, lack of fins, strong sense of smell, and Gooey Ability may draw inspiration from hagfish.",
    "description": "Wiglett is a long, white Pokémon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head and part of its body visible. It has beady dark blue eyes and a large, round, pink nose. Although Wiglett has a stated Pokédex height, it is unknown how long it really is underneath the sand, or what the rest of its body looks like.[1] Wiglett lives in beaches and seas, where it burrows into beach sand.[2] It pokes part of its body out of the ground to feed. Wiglett has an exceptional sense of smell, which has a range of over 60 feet (20 meters). Wiglett is a timid and cautious Pokémon; it hides in the sand when it picks up the scents of other Pokémon, such as Veluza, nearby.[1] Some researchers initially mistook Wiglett for the Paldean form of Diglett due to their physical resemblance, but they are separate species and differ in habitat and diet. It is theorized that the two species ended up having similar body plans as an adaptation to suit their environments and burrowing behavior.[1][2]"
