    "pokemon": "Corviknight",
    "pokedex_number": "0823",
    "origin": "Corviknight may be based on a raven, a carrion crow, or the western jackdaw; all three are corvids commonly found in Great Britain. Its overall appearance may be based on black knight characters from medieval settings. It may also draw inspiration from the Ravens of the Tower of London, a group of at least six ravens kept at the Tower of London, who are believed to protect the Crown and the Tower.",
    "description": "Corviknight is a large, avian Pokémon resembling a raven. Most of its body is a lustrous black, but its lower beak and legs have a matte color. Its feathers are tempered with steel. Its mantle, breast, belly, flanks, and scapular feathers are smooth and resemble plate armor. Corviknight's talons, head, and upper beak are similarly armored. It has a crest above its eyes that resembles a crown, and a ruff of feathers on its throat that resemble a beard. Corviknight's eyes have white pupils, red irises, and black sclerae. Corviknight is said to be the strongest bird Pokémon in the Galar region, being able to scare off any Pokémon that tries to challenge it. Due to its intelligence and flying skills, Corviknight serves a Flying Taxi service company called Galar Taxi, where it transports people from one location to another.[1] Corviknight preys on Bunnelby, and has violent territorial clashes with Skarmory. In Paldea, Corviknight is constantly attacked by Tinkaton, who pelts it with rocks as it flies; thus, Flying Taxis in Paldea use Squawkabilly instead of Corviknight to avoid potential dangers. Corviknight is the only known Pokémon that can have Mirror Armor as an Ability."
