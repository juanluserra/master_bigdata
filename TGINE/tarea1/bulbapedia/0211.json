    "descripcion": "Qwilfish is a sea dwelling piscine Pokémon with a spherical body and a flat, paddle-shaped tail. The upper half of its body is dark teal and the lower half is light greenish-yellow. Its tail is tall and thin with a dark teal outline, light greenish-yellow inside, and two dark teal dots in the center that resemble the Japanese character ハ Ha. Its eyes are even with its body and are always seen slanted angrily. Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips. All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time. In order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. Qwilfish is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pokémon. Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When Qwilfish faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can. If it is startled while inflated, it will spit out all its water, propelling itself away."
