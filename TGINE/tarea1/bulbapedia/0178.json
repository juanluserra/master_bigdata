    "pokemon": "Xatu",
    "pokedex_number": "0178",
    "origin": "Xatu seems to be based on a resplendent quetzal with design elements from a Native American totem or kachina. Behaviorally, it displays the ancient art of Sun Gazing, a form of spiritual meditation practiced by the Aztec and Mayan peoples in the belief that it would give them supernatural power (hence Xatu being Psychic-type).",
    "description": "Xatu is a green, condor-like Pokémon with long, red-and-black tipped white wings that cover most of its front. Underneath its wings are designs that resemble red eyes. Along with its main green coloration, Xatu's design has accents of black, yellow, and red. There is an extra set of yellow stripes on a male Xatu. It has almond eyes, a long, slightly hooked beak, and two long, red feather crests. Xatu's feet have only two toes, one in front and one in back. Xatu's design is similar to a totem pole or a kachina doll. Xatu tends to stand still all day, constantly observing the sun's movement. One theory explains that Xatu can see into the future with its right eye and the past with its left, and it does not move due to fears of its visions of the future coming true. The Pokémon the Series episode Xatu the Future has shown that it can communicate by moving its wings in a semaphore fashion. Xatu is believed to live in the forests of South America."
