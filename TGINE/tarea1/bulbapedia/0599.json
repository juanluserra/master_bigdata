    "descripcion": "Klink is a Pokémon resembling two interlocking gears with six teeth each. The teeth of the gears are light-gray, with a darker central region. Each gear has a white \"X\" in place of its left eye, while their right eyes have a black pupil and white sclerae. They have round turquoise noses and small mouths. Klink can launch itself at opponents. Klink and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Gear Grind. Prior to Generation VII, Shift Gear was also one of its signature moves. Once two bodies have joined, they cannot combine with any others or they will become separated. Klink generates its life energy by spinning, and is generally found in caves. According to Professor Juniper, the first recorded evidence of this Pokémon dates to around 100 years ago, in the Chargestone Cave; she believes that it suddenly appeared in the cave at that time. However, it is also believed that Klink are the inspiration behind the first gears invented by ancient people."
