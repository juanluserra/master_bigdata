    "origin": "Chimchar appears to be based on a young chimpanzee. However, the markings on its rear without the flame seem to indicate that it is more a cross between a chimpanzee and a young baboon.",
    "description": "Chimchar is a bipedal Pok√©mon resembling a chimpanzee. Its fur is primarily a shade of orange, although its face, outer ears, underbelly, hands, and feet are light yellow. Its ears are large in comparison to its head, and has red insides. It also has red markings around its eyes, as well as two pointed teeth in its upper jaw, a swirl-like symbol on its chest, and five fingers on its hands with three toes on its feet. It has a swirly crest of hair on its head. Its rear has a small, round, red patch that is usually obscured by flames produced by burning gas in its stomach. These flames cannot be put out by rain, although they go out when Chimchar goes to sleep, and burn weakly when it feels ill. In the past, this flame on its rear has caused people to mistake it for an apparition, dubbed the \"Lantern-Tail\". Chimchar is very agile, being able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains where it lives. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
