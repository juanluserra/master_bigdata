    "descripcion": "Delibird is a red, avian Pokémon with a white, hollow tail. Its face and chest are covered in white feathers with two, three-pointed crests above its eyes. Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each. Delibird is omnivorous. It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out.[1] Prior to Generation IX, Delibird was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. Iron Bundle shares a resemblance to Delibird and is believed to be a Delibird-based machine built by an ancient civilization. Delibird and its Paradox Pokémon counterpart, Iron Bundle are the only Pokémon capable of learning the movie Present."
