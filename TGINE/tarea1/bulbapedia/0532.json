    "origin": "Timburr's Pokédex entry supports that it and its evolutions are based on construction workers. Timburr in particular is always holding a square log of wood. Its body appears to be covered with swollen veins from physical labor. Due to its clownish nose, it may have also been based on a carny.",
    "description": "Timburr is a gray bipedal Pokémon with a dark purple nose and dark-gray oval-shaped eyes. It has bulbous protrusions extending from the front and lower parts of its head. Pink, vein-like bulges are present on the back of its head. Similar pink bands adorn its shoulders and thighs. It always carries squared logs and uses them to fight with. When it can easily lift a block of timber nearly three times its own weight, it is close to evolving. Timburr is usually found near construction sites, helping construction workers. It loves helping in construction so much that if rain causes work to cease, it will throw a tantrum while swinging its log."
