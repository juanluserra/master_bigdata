    "pokemon": "Mantine",
    "pokedex_number": "0226",
    "origin": "Mantine's appearance and behavior of breaching the water's surface is similar to a manta ray, a species belonging to the Mobula genus (also known as \"flying rays\"). It also has some kite-like aspects. Since Remoraid, a Pokémon based on a firearm, often attaches itself to the undersides of Mantine's wing-like fins, Mantine may also be based on a fighter plane. The circular patterns on its body and fins resemble roundels, common insignias on warplanes.",
    "description": "Mantine is a large, ray-like Pokémon. Its body is dark blue on the overside, and it has large wing-like fins, with a black ring-shaped mark on the top of either fin, and a jagged outline on the front rim at the bottom. Its head has two long protrusions resembling horns or antennae, and two more black ring-shaped marks on the back. Two pairs of gills are visible on its pinkish gray underside, as well as a pair of beady eyes and a small mouth. Its body has a coarse texture. Mantine thrives in open seas where it swims freely, often in schools where they race one another. It can breach out of the water and fly 300 feet (100 meters) into the air if it builds up enough speed. In the past, it was often misidentified as a bird Pokémon by observers who saw this behavior. Mantine is sometimes seen with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one of its fins, scavenging for its leftovers and fighting together with it when attacked. Mantine has a docile nature, and does not mind the Remoraid clinging onto its fin. In Alola, many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine. This has made it an icon in the region, being featured on souvenir postcards and posters."
