    "pokemon": "Gloom",
    "pokedex_number": "0044",
    "origin": "Gloom seems to be based on a mandrake, plants from the Mandragora genus whose roots sometimes resemble human figures, and the budding stage of Rafflesia, a genus of parasitic plants known for their large, foul smelling flowers. Its brown leaves may also allude to its parasitic origins, as if the flower is drawing nutrients away from Oddish's formerly green leaves and causing them to wilt. Female Gloom resemble Rafflesia hasseltii due to the larger spots on their petals.",
    "description": "Gloom is a blue, bipedal Rafflesia-like  Pok√©mon with rudimentary hands and feet. On its head is a flower with spherical petals surrounded by four reddish-brown leaves. The petals are a dark reddish-brown and have white spots. A female displays a single large spot on each petal, while a male will have many smaller spots. Gloom's eyes are wide and often appear closed and its lips are thin and purple. Gloom trickles sticky nectar from its mouth with the appearance and consistency of drool. This can be used as a fertilizer for plants. Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile (1.6 kilometers) away. However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing. This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production. When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe. Gloom lives in grassy plains. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move."
