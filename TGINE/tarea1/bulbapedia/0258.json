    "pokemon": "Mudkip",
    "pokedex_number": "0258",
    "origin": "Mudkip appears to be based on the mudpuppy or mudskipper, or also possibly an axolotl. As it is the Mud Fish Pokémon, it might also be based on the gilled East African lungfish or the flathead catfish, also known as the mudcat.",
    "description": "Mudkip is a small, amphibious, quadrupedal Pokémon. It has a blue body with a light blue underside. Mudkip has a large head with a blue fin on top and a light-blue tail fin. It has black, beady eyes and orange, star-shaped gills on its cheeks. By using the fin on its head, Mudkip can detect changes in air and water currents as well as bodies of water. Its fin can also point in a certain direction, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Date Expectations. Despite its small size, Mudkip is a very strong Pokémon. Mudkip is capable of moving or crushing boulders larger than itself. Its large tail fin provides powerful acceleration to propel it through the water. According to its Pokémon Ranger browser entry, Mudkip is a very docile Pokémon. Mudkip is more commonly found in captivity, though it can be found in swamps and other wetlands. In the wild, it sleeps by burying itself in the mud soil at the water's edge or bottom of a river. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
