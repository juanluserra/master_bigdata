    "descripcion": "Rellor is a small, brown, beetle-like Pok√©mon. It has four horn-like protrusions on its head, and its face is pink with lazy eyes, a bulbous nose, and black curved stripes over and under it that resemble a unibrow and a chinstrap beard. Its abdomen has a rounded yellow pattern, and it has four long limbs, each tipped with two claws. On its back is a random pattern of beige stripes resembling a maze. Rellor almost always orients itself upside down as it rolls around a mud ball, which is brown in color with random white and orange stripes. Rellor creates its mud ball by mixing dirt and sand with psychic energy. It values its mud ball more than its own life, and rolls it around as the energy needed for it to evolve matures. Its hind legs are strong enough to lift the mud ball over its body."
