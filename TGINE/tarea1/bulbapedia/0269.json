    "pokemon": "Dustox",
    "pokedex_number": "0269",
    "origin": "Dustox seems to be based on the Japanese luna moth or Japanese moon moth due to its green wings, nocturnal habits, and ability to learn Moonlight. Its Poison-type may be based on butterflies and moths that retain toxic chemicals in their bodies from the plants they consume as larva. Its Shiny colors resemble the Japanese silk moth.",
    "description": "Dustox is a moth-like Pokémon with two pairs of wings. It has a purple, egg-shaped body with a jagged fringe on its rear. Its tattered, green wings are wide and flat, forming a disc-shape around its body. They have red markings in the form of rings and streaks, a darker green line around the edges, and contain toxic dust. This Pokémon has two pairs of red, stubby legs and yellow, stylized compound eyes. There is a pair of fuzzy, yellow antennae on top of Dustox's head, which are smaller on the female. These antennae are used to seek food. Dustox is nocturnal and is instinctively drawn to light. Swarms are attracted by the bright light of cities, where they wreak havoc by devouring the leaves off roadside trees. When attacked, Dustox unleashes toxic scales from its wings; these toxins are powerful enough to make even a pro wrestler sick. As a result, people often have a difficult time driving Dustox swarms away from settlements. It lives in forests, fields and mountains."
