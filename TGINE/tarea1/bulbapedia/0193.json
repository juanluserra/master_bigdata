    "pokemon": "Yanma",
    "pokedex_number": "0193",
    "origin": "Yanma seems to be based on a dragonfly, possibly the banded darter. Because of its size and weight, it might have been inspired by prehistoric ancestors to modern dragonflies and damselflies in the Meganeura genus, commonly referred to as \"griffinflies\". This is further supported by its evolution, Yanmega, which is much more closely linked to ancient dragonflies, and whose offspring did not have a larval stage, instead hatching directly into a smaller version of their adult phase, as Yanma is a fully formed dragonfly. This connection is further referenced by its evolution method.",
    "description": "Yanma is a large, red insectoid Pok√©mon that resembles a dragonfly. Compared to its long, thin abdomen, its thorax is short and wide. It has three pairs of gray two-toed legs and two pairs of wings with red bands on them. The see through wings are described as frail and thin. A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body at 360 degrees without even moving its head. This allows Yamma to have a high evasiveness. The end of Yanma's tail has two flat extensions from the sides and two gray spikes in the center. Yanma is a skillful flier. It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed. Yamma's eyes ensure the prey will not escape its sight, even when behind. It can also generate shock waves capable of breaking glass or even launching a house skyward by flapping its wings very fast. Yanma is often found in wooded and swampy areas. It hunts insects for food, using its eyesight to spot and its flight abilities to pursue prey. Yanma is also territorial, flitting around to guard its territory."
