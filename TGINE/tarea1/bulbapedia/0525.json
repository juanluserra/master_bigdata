    "pokemon": "Boldore",
    "pokedex_number": "0525",
    "origin": "Boldore appears to be based on a geode and elemental creature, specifically a being of earth. It also has some aspects of a crab with the three-legged structure of a tripod.",
    "description": "Boldore is a blue, rock-like Pok√©mon with an array of red crystals on its back and front, and a spine protruding from between its yellow ears. Rocky chunks at its sides comprise pincer-like limbs, tipped with red crystals similar to the ones on its back. Its orange crystals, which are tough enough to break diamonds, are the hardened form of its endlessly leaking energy. Boldore's crystals shine brightly when it begins overflowing with power or when it is preparing to fire bursts of energy. Because its crystals are valuable, with a fragment being capable of powering a hundred dump trucks, Boldore is targeted for them. It searches for underground water in the caves where it lives; however, because it is uncomfortable around water, it is always very careful about lapping it up. A healthy Boldore will always have its core sticking out. Due to relying on sound to know what is nearby, it always faces the same way, never moving in a diagonal direction; even when brought to anger, it will attack while facing in its initial direction."
