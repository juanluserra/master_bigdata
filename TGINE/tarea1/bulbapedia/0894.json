    "descripcion": "Regieleki is an electric golem-like Pokémon made mostly of electric energy generated by a single organ. It has a round yellow body with three spikes on top of its head, and a pattern of seven pink dots on its face that resembles the letter \"X\". Regieleki's arms are shaped like lightning and usually appear bunched together, while its legs are tiny and resemble both lightning bolts and an electrical plug. Its body can glow bright yellow when attacking. Regieleki has five blue rings on its body, with two on the base of its arms acting as its shoulders, and the other three located at the bottom connecting to its legs. According to legend, Regieleki was created by the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas using pure electric energy. It used to be worshipped by humans, however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away in the Split-Decision Ruins. The blue rings are insulated and cannot conduct electricity, they've been put on it by ancient people who were tormented by it, in order to restrain its powers.[1]. It is said that if the rings on its body were to be removed, Regieleki would be able to unleash its latent powers. Regieleki absorbs electrons in order to stay alive and is said to have the greatest power of any Electric-type Pokémon,[1] being powerful enough to generate all of Galar's electricity. It can trap its foes inside a cage of sparking electricity that inflicts damage overtime. Regieleki is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Thunder Cage. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Transistor as an Ability."
