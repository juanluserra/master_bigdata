    "pokemon": "Relicanth",
    "pokedex_number": "0369",
    "origin": "Relicanth appears to be based on the coelacanth, an order of fish that was thought to have gone extinct around 66 million years ago until their rediscovery in 1938. They are considered living fossils because they appear virtually unchanged from their prehistoric relatives; this is reflected in Relicanth's Rock typing (characteristic of actual Fossil Pokémon) and \"elderly\" appearance. Relicanth matches the Indonesian coelacanth in color, but its Shiny coloration is like that of the more well-known West Indian Ocean coelacanth. The irregular shapes on Relicanth's brown body with big red spot might be inspired by old treasure maps.",
    "description": "Relicanth is a Pokémon that is heavily based on the coelacanth. It is covered with hard, brown scales that are similar to craggy rocks. Its tan head has protruding cheekbones, which are smaller on a female. A triangular spike protrudes from the back of its head. Tan patches cover its body and there is a red spot located on both sides. It possesses two pairs of pectoral fins, which it uses to push itself along the sea bottom. Additionally, it has dorsal and pelvic fins near its tail. Its tail fin has a wavy outline. The composition of its scales, along with its fatty body and oil-filled swim bladders, allow it to withstand the intense pressure of the ocean depths. Relicanth once had teeth, but they have long since atrophied; as such, Relicanth is a filter feeder, feeding on microscopic organisms that it sucks up with its toothless mouth. It has remained unchanged for 100 million years and stays as such because it is already a perfect life-form.  It was discovered during a deep-sea expedition. Relicanth's name comes from an explorer whose name served as a variation of it."
