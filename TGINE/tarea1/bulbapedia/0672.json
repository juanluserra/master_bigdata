    "descripcion": "Skiddo is a quadrupedal, goat-like Pokémon covered with shaggy, dark brown fur. It has a white face with a brown blaze down the middle, a round black nose, black eyes, a short beard, and small rounded ears. On top of its head are a pair of pointed black horns extending out to the sides. It has a white stocking on each leg and cloven, orange hooves. There is a leafy green mane around its neck that extends along its back. The mane ends at its tail, which is made up of three short leaves. Skiddo can perform photosynthesis with the leaves on its back, which means that it does not need to eat so long as it has sunshine and water. It has a docile nature and is thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live alongside humans, who ride on it to travel across mountains. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: XY episode A Race for Home!, milk from Skiddo can be used to make dairy products. Skiddo and its evolution, Gogoat, are the only known Pokémon that can have Grass Pelt as an Ability."
