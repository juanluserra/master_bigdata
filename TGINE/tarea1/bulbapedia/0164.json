    "descripcion": "Noctowl is an avian Pokémon that resembles an owl. It has light brown plumage with a darker brown pattern of triangles on its chest. Its fan-like tail is the same dark brown, while its wings are a slightly lighter shade of brown with light brown undersides. It has red eyes with black rings around them and a second, cream-colored ring around the first. Above its eyes are bushy, cream-colored feather \"horns\" that resemble large eyebrows. Its small beak and talons are pinkish, and its feet are cream-colored with three toes facing forward and one backward. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Throwing in the Noctowl, an elderly Noctowl can grow a small beard. Noctowl is a nocturnal Pokémon that is called \"the emperor of dark nights\" by some. It has exceptional eyes that concentrate the faintest light and give it night vision, supple wings capable of silent flight, and it can twist its head at a 180-degree angle to increase its intellect. Its superior senses and intellect allow it to catch prey without fail in the darkness. It can also turn its head upside down, which signals that it is troubled by something. If disturbed in this state, it will peck at the offender. Noctowl is most commonly found nesting in trees in temperate and boreal forests. In Kitakami, Noctowl is used for the region's Flying Taxi service."
