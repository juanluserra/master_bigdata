    "descripcion": "Furret is a long, slim-bodied mustelid Pokémon with cream-colored fur and dark brown rings along the length of its body. The back of its head and neck are also dark brown; this marking extends to below its arms where the first ring is formed. It has cream-colored tips on its ears, two brown, whisker-like markings on each cheek, and round, black eyes. Its four limbs are stubby; the forepaws are brown and the hind paws are cream-colored. Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs but prefers to move on all fours. Its body and tail are so similar in structure that it is impossible to tell where its tail begins. Despite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile. This allows Furret to escape even when in the arms of a human. Its speed allows it to catch prey such as Rattata. It tends to burrow under the ground of meadows and other temperate grasslands. Its narrow burrows are well-suited for its slim body and are very difficult for other Pokémon to enter. The burrows also become more maze-like deeper inside, which makes it even harder to find Furret's nest. A mother Furret curls itself around its offspring to help them sleep. Once the offspring are older, the mother Furret will take them outside to prepare them for independence. In Lental, Mightyena is a natural predator of Furret."
