    "descripcion": "Rookidee is a small, birdlike Pokémon that is primarily dark blue, including its wings, tail, back and part of its head. The lower part of its body and chest is yellow, and it has a plume of black feathers that begins from under its wings to its face, from which a few tufts protrude over its head, giving it a mask-like appearance. It has red eyes with white markings under them, which helps Rookidee to intimidate fearful Pokémon. It has small gray legs and feet, each with two toes on the front and one on the back. Rookidee are feisty and territorial Pokémon and will bravely fight against anybody, no matter how big and strong that opponent is. They are able to store some of their own energy after every battle, so they can grow a bit stronger even if they lose. Using their legs, they are able to jump nimbly from place to place to confuse Pokémon bigger than themselves. Female Rookidee are fussier than the males, and will relentlessly attack anyone who dirties its wings. Rookidee preys on Grubbin."
