    "descripcion": "Avalugg is a massive Pok√©mon covered almost entirely in semi-transparent ice. Through the ice on its head, diamond-shaped, yellow eyes are visible. Its head is wedge-shaped with a white diamond-shaped ice chunk on each side in place of ears, a dark chink in the ice over each eye, a crack just before the tip of its snout, and a beard of short icicles. The top of Avalugg's body is flat with three horizontal cracks along the surface and there is a collection of icicles along its belly. Its legs are cylindrical with cracks just before its foot and in-between its toes; underneath each toe is a spiked claw. Pale purple colorations can be found on the insides of its cracks. Avalugg's body is hard as steel, which allows it to crush anything in its way. It has been known to allow Bergmite to huddle on top of its back, which causes it to resemble an aircraft carrier. Avalugg carries the Bergmite on its back across oceans and to new habitats. During the day, the cracks in Avalugg's body deepen; they return to normal overnight. It lives in high altitudes, and co-exists with Cetitan."
