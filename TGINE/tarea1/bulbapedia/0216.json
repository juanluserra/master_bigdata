    "descripcion": "Teddiursa is a bipedal, ursine Pokémon covered in short, orange-brown fur. Its muzzle is a light tan color with a small black nose and black eyes with white irises. There is a slightly paler tan crescent moon marking on its face, and it has round ears. It has three claws on its forepaws as well as two claws and yellow paw pads on its hind paws. Its tail is short, round, and puffy. Teddiursa is almost always seen licking its forepaws, which are soaked in honey — every Teddiursa has a different flavor on its paws. When it feels nervous, it will lick its paws to calm itself down. The marking on its face can glow when it finds honey. While Teddiursa is able to make its own honey by blending pollen collected by Beedrill with fruits, it is also known to steal honey from Combee nests, which it finds by stealthily following the Combee. Teddiursa lives in mountainous forests, where it will hide food throughout its territory before food becomes scarce in winter."
