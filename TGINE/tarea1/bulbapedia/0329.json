    "descripcion": "Vibrava is a dragonfly-like Pok√©mon. It has a small head with two yellow antennae and green bulging eyes with black oval-shaped pupils. Its mouth has two large white teeth protruding from each side. It has a skinny yellow body, four skinny black legs with slender feet, and four green, rhombus-shaped wings with black edges. There are similarly-colored rhombus shapes at the end of its tail. Vibrava's wings are not fully developed, so it is unable to fly very far. However, it is able to create vibrations and ultrasonic waves with its wings. Humans get headaches from these waves. After causing the prey to faint, as a saprotroph, it spits stomach acid to melt its prey before consumption. It continues this eating process every day to help its wings grow. Vibrava calls the desert home and is also known to preserve its captured prey in the desert's hot sands."
