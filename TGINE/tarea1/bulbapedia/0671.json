    "descripcion": "Florges is a slender Pokémon with a white upper body and a green lower body. Its head is rounded with a pointed, upturned nose; long, teardrop-shaped ears; and dark eyes with lengthy, green, plantlike lashes. Surrounding its head is an ornate bouquet of flowers that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. It has slender arms with three tiny fingers and two black diamond shapes on its chest. Its lower body resembles a mermaid's tail with two large leaves sprouting above the tailfin. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Florges can live for several hundred years and devotes its life to protecting gardens. It claims beautiful flower gardens as its territory and can control the flowers it grows. [1] It also gains power by basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants. A Florges's flower garden is said to contain healing properties for both body and spirit. In the past, it was asked to create flower gardens for castles. Because of this, Florges was popular with castle governors. Florges can live for up to several hundred years, over the course of which it will spend protecting gardens. While Florges can be compassionate, it will hunt down anyone who vandalizes the flower garden it takes care of, punishing them without mercy, even if said person begs for it. It can fire beams similar to batteries of artillery. Prior to Generation VII, Florges and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities."
