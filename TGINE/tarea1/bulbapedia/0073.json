    "pokemon": "Tentacruel",
    "pokedex_number": "0073",
    "origin": "Tentacruel may take inspiration from the jellyfish and the Portuguese man o' war, as evidenced by its category and prototype English name, respectively. It also shares some characteristics of a squid. Additionally, Tentacruel resembles several varieties of the bug-eyed monster and other alien invaders from 1950s B-movies, which is reflected in its ability to fire lasers from the gems on its head.",
    "description": "Tentacruel is a large, cnidarian Pokémon. It has a clear, light blue body with two large, red orbs on either side and a smaller orb in the center. Its eyes are visible in its round lower body, which is black. Extending from its lower body are two blue, beak-like appendages and numerous grayish tentacles. Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, communicating with its own kind, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves. Tentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey in a net-like shape before immobilizing it with poison. The tentacles can grow or shrink with ease. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages. While Tentacruel are rarely seen, they can gather in large groups which scares away any nearby fish Pokémon. Tentacruel lives in underwater rock formations and can be found throughout the ocean. Although Toedscruel bears a strong resemblance to Tentacruel, the two species are biologically unrelated."
