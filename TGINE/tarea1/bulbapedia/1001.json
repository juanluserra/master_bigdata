    "descripcion": "Wo-Chien is a snail-like Pokémon comprising a dark-green mossy form covered in dead green and yellow leaves. Two pairs of long, curling vines form its eyestalks, which contain eyes with green eyelids, orange sclerae, and pale greenish pupils. A long row of wooden tablets curled around its backside forms its shell. Wooden tablets were once used as a writing medium in the East during ancient times, although the inscriptions written on the particular set forming Wo-Chien's shell have become too faded to be read. Like the other treasures of ruin, Wo-Chien's true form is the row of wooden writing tablets forming its shell, having been given life by the grudges of the person punished for writing the evil deeds of a king on them long ago — while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over plant matter. Wo-Chien is able to drain the life force of vegetations in a wide area around it, causing entire forests and fields to instantly become barren. It is known as the Tablets of Ruin. Wo-Chien and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ruination. Wo-Chien is also the only known Pokémon that can have Tablets of Ruin as an Ability."
