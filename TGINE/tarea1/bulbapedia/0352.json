    "description": "Kecleon is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon that is usually green. On either side of its head are yellow frills, which are connected by lines to its yellow lips and rings around its eyes. There are small ridges on its shoulders and a red zigzag stripe around its midsection. The hands and feet have three short digits each, and it has yellow soles. It also has a long skinny tail that is usually curled tightly in a spiral. Kecleon is able to change the colors of its body at will and is known for frequently using this ability to camouflage itself. However, it is unable to change the color of its red stripe. Its color also changes based on its mood and health, darkening in color with better health. By using camouflage to appear almost invisible, it can sneak up on prey and ensnare it with its long pink tongue. If unnoticed for too long, though, it pouts and may never reveal itself. This Pokémon lives in tropical and temperate forests. Although Kecleon typically appears as green with yellow stripes, it is known to possess various non-Shiny color variations. A purplish variant of Kecleon appeared in the Pokémon the Series episode The Kecleon Caper, as a TCG card, and in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series; the purplish Kecleon in the latter also has light-green outlines rather than yellow. Blue, red, and brown variants of Kecleon have made a singular appearance in the TCG. Whether these variants are an example of it changing color or if they are different kinds of Kecleon is unclear. Kecleon is the only known Pokémon that can have Color Change as an Ability. In Generation VIII, this was also true for Protean."
