    "descripcion": "Frogadier is a light-blue, bipedal, frog-like Pokémon. A dark blue marking covers its head and forms a three-pointed mark down its upper back. Its eyes have yellow sclerae, black irises, and white pupils. Its eyes protrude slightly from the top of its head and each has a backward-facing spike above it. It has a white bubble scarf, dark blue hands and circular toes, and white circular fingers. Frogadier is a nimble and swift Pokémon; it can scale a tower exceeding 2,000 feet (600 meters) in one minute. It can also throw bubble-coated pebbles at targets up to 100 feet (30 meters) away. The reason for this is due to the tips of its fingers and toes allowing it to stick firmly onto vertical surfaces. It can confound opponents by leaping about ceilings or into trees.[1] Frogadier is an expert on creating battle strategies that make use of the terrain. Due to this, it will never miss its mark when throwing bubble-covered pebbles."
