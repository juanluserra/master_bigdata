    "descripcion": "Spoink is a gray, pig-like Pokémon. It has dark, circular eyes, a large gray nose, and small ears. It has stubby arms and possesses no hind legs. Motion is achieved by bouncing on its spring-like tail. The bouncing has a vital function, in that it keeps its heart beating. Even while it is sleeping, it continues to bounce. It wears a pearl produced by Clamperl on top of its head, which amplifies its psychic powers. Spoink will be weakened without a pearl, and always searches for bigger pearls. In the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Pearls are a Spoink's Best Friend, it was shown to easily mistake other round objects as its pearl. It lives in mountainous areas. It likes to eat mushrooms that grow underground. In Generation III, Magic Coat was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
