    "description": "Sunflora is a plant Pok√©mon with a sunflower-like design, having a green trunk and limbs. Its head is circular and cream-colored, with yellow petals growing along the rim. The petals become more vivid as the weather becomes warmer. Sunflora's face has two eyes that appear perpetually closed, and a thin line running vertical beside each eye. Sunflora has leaves extending like arms from its round body and two toes on each foot. Sunflora converts sunlight into nutrition. Because of this, it tends to pursue sunlight and is always looking in the direction of the sun. While the sun is up, it moves around in a hectic manner. When the sun sets, it comes to a complete stop and closes its petals. In addition to sunlight, Sunflora needs plenty of water. The animated series demonstrates that sunlight can cause a Sunflora's head to grow. Too much sunlight exposure will grow their heads so big that it will immobilize a Sunflora. Sunflora is rarely seen in the wild, but it can sometimes be found in temperate grassy meadows."
