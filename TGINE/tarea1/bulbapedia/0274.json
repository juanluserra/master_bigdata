    "pokemon": "Nuzleaf",
    "pokedex_number": "0274",
    "origin": "Nuzleaf appears to be based on a sprouting acorn and a tengu, Japanese yōkai with long noses who use their supernatural powers to protect forests and play cruel tricks on people. It may also be partly based on the similarly named shibatengu, childlike yōkai who wear little clothing and sumo wrestle with humans. Its habit of playing a grass flute is reminiscent of Pan, the Greek god of nature known for playing reed pipes. Its wooden, humanoid body and long nose are also reminiscent of Pinocchio.",
    "description": "Nuzleaf is a bipedal plant Pokémon with a single green leaf atop its head. The leaf is smaller on the female. This Pokémon is mostly brown with a beige mask marking on its face. Its bulky thighs are also beige and have thin striations, and there are what appear to be two nipples on its chest. It has thin arms with mitten-like hands. If its long, pointed nose is grabbed, Nuzleaf will lose its power. The nose serves functions as a sensory. Using the leaf on its head as a flute, it makes music with leaves that create a sense of unease in people. However, it can also play comforting melodies. Nuzleaf lives in tropical forests and is skilled at climbing, but it will come out of the forest to frighten people. Nuzleaf uses a sound similar to a grass tune to warn wandering intruders. In Generation III, Extrasensory was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
