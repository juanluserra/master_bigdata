    "descripcion": "Nidoking is a large, bipedal, purple mammalian Pokémon with distinct reptilian features. It has narrow eyes, large, spiny ears, fur-like tufts on its cheeks, and a short snout filled with pointed teeth. A long, venomous horn is on its forehead and a ridge of spines down its back. Gray plates cover its chest and belly, with a gray, rounded spine on each elbow. Each hand has three claws, while each foot has only a single hoof-like nail. It has a long, powerful tail. Nidoking is a male-only species. It is said that Nidoking's tail can topple a metal transmission tower. Nidoking uses this tail to smash, constrict, or break the bones of its prey and enemies. The tail can also be swung to create distance between it and its foes before Nidoking charges. Its steel-like hide adds to its powerful, rampaging charges. Nidoking's horn is powerful enough to crush diamonds. Nidoking is known to be very proud of its own strength. When Nidoking goes on a rampage, it becomes impossible to control. Only a Nidoqueen that it has lived with for a long time can calm it down from its rampages. As shown in the 21st chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Nidoking has strong acid within its claws. Being the result of evolution via an Evolution stone, Nidoking is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains."
