    "descripcion": "Gabite is a medium-sized, bipedal, dragon-like Pokémon that is primarily blue. Its underside is light blue, with red covering it from the middle of its abdomen to the bottoms of its jaw. Gabite has two appendages that resemble jets or plane engines extending out the side of its skull. Each appendage has a blue stripe. It has four fins: one on each arm, one on its back, and another on its tail. The back fin has a notch on it for the male. It has spikes on its hind limbs, and sharp claws on its feet and wrists. Its eyes have black sclerae and gold colored irises. Gabite is a fierce and predatory Pokémon known for its scales, which are believed to have medicinal properties and the ability to heal most illnesses, even those thought to be incurable. Gabite has short, extremely sharp teeth, like its pre-evolved form Gible. It has been known to move at extreme speeds. The protrusions on Gabite's head allows it to emit ultrasound waves, which can be used for navigating through pitch-dark caves. Gabite is also a very territorial creature and will fight back against enemies to protect its home. Gabite is passionate about shiny objects, such as gems, treasures, and even Carbink, and it hoards a collection of them in its nest. When it sees Sableye trying to take Carbink as food, Gabite jealously attacks the Sableye. Despite its aggressive demeanor, giving Gabite a sparkly item such as a glass bead can turn it docile. It predominantly lives in mountainous regions, and can survive in both snowy and arid temperatures. In Generation IX, Gabite and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability."
