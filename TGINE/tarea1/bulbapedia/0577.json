    "pokemon": "Solosis",
    "pokedex_number": "0577",
    "origin": "Solosis and the rest of its evolutionary line seem to bear reference to cells, with the head representing the nucleus, the green substance surrounding their bodies resembling cytoplasm and the objects inside their bodies representing organelles. The line down its head also resembles a cleavage furrow in cell biology. It may also make allusion to the embryonary stages, specifically the stage of morula.",
    "description": "Solosis is a round, green Pok√©mon surrounded by a darker green, gel-like substance. This liquid covering allows Solosis to live under any conditions, even in the vacuum of space, but when taking heavy blows, its fluid covering may leak away. Its inner body has dark, oval eyes and a red diamond-shaped mouth. On the upper left side of its head is a curly, yellow growth that resembles the endoplasmic reticulum of a cell. It uses psychic powers to communicate with telepathy, as well as to drive away potential threats."
