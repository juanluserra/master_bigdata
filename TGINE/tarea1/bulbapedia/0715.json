    "pokemon": "Noivern",
    "pokedex_number": "0715",
    "origin": "Noivern seems to be based on a combination of wyvern, a long-eared bat, fruit bat, or a leaf-nosed bat, and loudspeaker or tweeter. Inspiration for its design may also have been drawn from gargoyles.",
    "description": "Noivern is a large, draconic Pokémon that resembles a bat. It is primarily black with a purple underbelly and greenish turquoise wing membranes. It has a purple lower jaw; a large, red, V-shaped nose; two fang-like projections on its upper lip; yellow eyes; and a greenish-turquoise color between its eyes and nose. Its large, teardrop-shaped ears have alternating rings of blue-green and black on the interiors and resemble loudspeakers. Around its neck is a fluffy mane of white fur that is longer in the back. Its wings have three red claws on the middle joint and are divided into segments by two black wing fingers. On the back of the wing, the final segment is purple. Noivern's feet have two toes each and a red, claw-like growth on top of each toe. It has a long, whip-like tail with a blue-green underside and two spines near the tip. Noivern is known for its violent temper, but becomes tame if approached with its favorite ripe fruits. From its ears, it can produce ultrasonic waves strong enough to shatter large boulders. It uses these waves to freely navigate through the darkness.[1] Noivern is also known to be cruel, ruthlessly tormenting enemies that cannot see well in the dark — such as Hydreigon — before using its ultrasonic waves and fangs to finish them off. However, Noivern becomes timid when exposed to the light."
