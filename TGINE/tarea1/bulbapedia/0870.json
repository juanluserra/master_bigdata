    "descripcion": "Falinks is a group of small, bipedal Pokémon. A single Falinks is a formation of six individuals, similar to Exeggcute. It consists of five troopers and a leader, known as \"the brass\". Falinks usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of a caterpillar. This formation is known as the Column formation. However, Falinks occasionally break their formation to attack. The six members rely on teamwork as their strategy to win battles, and constantly change formation when they fight. The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. Falinks are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in Route 8, where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. A common formation that the members change into is a form in which the troopers stand in a triangular formation around the brass, either in front of or behind it. This formation is known as the No Retreat formation, as the members stand in this formation when using the move No Retreat. In Pokémon Journeys: The Series, the six individual Falinks are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In Pokémon UNITE, it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation. An individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail. The Falinks brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face. Falinks is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move No Retreat."
