    "descripcion": "Poipole is a small, purple Ultra Beast. It has a bipedal build with a large head and relatively small limbs with no visible digits. On its head are three spikes: one in the front and one on each side. A single gray needle protrudes from the top of its head and there are additional needles in the spikes on the sides of its head. It has oval eyes with a single eyelash-like spike above each; its mouth and eyes give off a cyan glow. It has a long, tapering tail with a single spine in the middle. While most of its body is dark purple, it has several fuchsia markings: at the tip of each head-spike, on its chest, on top of its head, and on its face. In the games, Poipole originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space, where it is popular as a first partner Pokémon. However, Poipole originates from an unnamed world in Pokémon the Series. It is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. Poipole's large head is filled with a glowing, adhesive poison, which it can fire from the needles on its head.[1] While spraying opponents with this venom, it laughs wildly. As seen in the animated series, Poipole can also shoot a harmless multicolored substance as a way to paint, which can be also used to communicate with humans and Pokémon. It is shown to have the habit to stand upside down and spin rapidly as a sign of happiness and excitement. Like all Ultra Beasts, Poipole stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura[2]. In The Shape of Love to Come!, it is revealed that wild Poipole live in large numbers in huge nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel, who serves as a queen."
