    "descripcion": "Elgyem is a cyan-colored extraterrestrial Pok√©mon with an oblong head with depressions on either side. It has black, symmetrical lines going down the front of its head. On the front of its head are shiny, green button-like eyes. Its hands have three finger-like digits: one red, one green, and one yellow. It has short, stubby legs and a small tail. Elgyem controls incredible psychic power, which it uses to squeeze its opponent's brains, causing them headaches. Its origin is said to be linked with a UFO crash site that appeared 50 years ago. Overall, Elgyem has quite the welcoming and informative behavior. It is willing to help in stressful and otherwise difficult situations. However, Elgyem can become fully involved in something it feels to be important and protect that with its life. If Elgyem stands near a television, strange scenery will start appearing on the screen, which is said to be its home."
