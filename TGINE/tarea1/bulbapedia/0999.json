    "descripcion": "Gimmighoul is a small, blue-gray, metallic, bipedal Pok√©mon, with bands of two thin black stripes present around its torso and between its gold, circular eyes. It has a pair of thin black antennae and a tail, which are bent near the base and tipped with small gold circles. Its antennae vibrate when detecting something it deems notable, and will point at objects of interest. When Gimmighoul gathers 999 Gimmighoul Coins, it evolves into Gholdengo."
