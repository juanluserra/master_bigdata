    "pokemon": "Gimmighoul",
    "pokedex_number": "0999",
    "origin": "As indicated by its English name, Gimmighoul may be based on the ghoul, a mythical creature from Arabic folklore known for luring people into deserted places before preying on them, and stealing coins. The word ghoul (Arabic: غُول ghūl) stems from the Arabic word غَالَ ghāla, meaning \"to seize\". Gimmighoul's antennae and tail resemble dowsing rods, which are believed to be able to help people locate buried treasures. The association of a ghost with coins, as well as its eyes resembling coins, may also draw inspiration from Charon's obol, where the deceased are buried with coins as a preparation for the afterlife. The coins were frequently placed in the mouth or on the eyes.",
    "description": "Gimmighoul is a small, blue-gray, metallic, bipedal Pokémon, with bands of two thin black stripes present around its torso and between its gold, circular eyes. It has a pair of thin black antennae and a tail, which are bent near the base and tipped with small gold circles. Its antennae vibrate when detecting something it deems notable, and will point at objects of interest. When Gimmighoul gathers 999 Gimmighoul Coins, it evolves into Gholdengo."
