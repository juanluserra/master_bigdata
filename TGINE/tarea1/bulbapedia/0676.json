It has round, red eyes with blue eyelids, a pointed snout with a round, light blue nose, and long rectangular ears. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen on its upper jaw. Furfrou used to guard the king in the ancient times of Kalos and is known to be loyal to its Trainer.[1] Furfrou is said to be very intelligent.
