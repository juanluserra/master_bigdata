    "descripcion": "Cufant is a roughly spherical elephantine Pok√©mon with a body made of copper. The tip of its trunk is shaped like a spoon or shovel, and Cufant uses it to dig in the ground and carve out rocks and ores to eat. It has four stout legs, and each leg has a single anterior nail. Cufant has a bulbous dome atop its head and a short bobtail. Most of its body is a tangerine color, but its ventral side is lighter. It's also covered in patches of green where rain has tarnished the copper in its skin. It has two such patches at the base of its trunk, and a dappled tarnish pattern on its domed skull and dorsal side. The tip of its trunk and the rims of its nails are also tarnished green, and it has a green patch behind each of its eyes. Cufant is said to be tremendously strong, carrying loads of over five tons with minimal effort. Cufant and Copperajah are docile in nature, and were introduced to the Galar and Paldea regions to assist with heavy labor. It travels in herds, searching for food in caves in the morning."
