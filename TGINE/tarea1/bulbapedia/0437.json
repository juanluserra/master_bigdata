    "descripcion": "Bronzong is a large Pokémon resembling a blue-green bell with two arms coming out of its sides. It has a hollow body and a yoke attached at the top. Its face can be best described as being a \"Totem Pole\" design; Bronzong has two round, red eyes with blue-green irises and a rectangular mouth with one visible row of square teeth. It also has several darker, rectangular markings on its body. When angered, Bronzong lets out a warning cry that rings out like the tolling of a bell. It can summon rain clouds, which earned it the nickname \"bringer of plentiful harvests\" and led to some referring to it as a deity since ancient times. Bronzong's cry is also believed to have the power to open a hole leading to other worlds. Many scientists believe the Bronzong found in Galar originated from a different region after researching the patterns on its body. Some Bronzong can sleep up to 2,000 years, with one such case leading to quite the media story when one was discovered at a construction site. Bronzong typically lives in ruins and mountain ranges. Prior to Generation VIII, Bronzong and its pre-evolved form, Bronzor, were the only known Pokémon that could have Heatproof as an Ability."
