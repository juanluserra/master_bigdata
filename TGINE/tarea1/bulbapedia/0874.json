    "descripcion": "Stonjourner is a tall Pokémon made of rock, resembling Stonehenge. It has a gray, rectangular body with white eyes and mouth, and is adorned with dark gray spots. On top of its body are two, smaller rectangular stones giving it the appearance of a hat. Its arms are made up of three chained, square rocks alternating between gray and dark gray. It has two large, gray legs resembling the standing stones on Turffield, each of which weighs over 400 pounds (200 kg). These legs are brown on the lower half, and have a pair of gray crosses each. In the TCG, a resting Stonjourner is shown to be able to detach and rotate its legs. Occasionally, Stonjourner will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it stands in a field watching the sun's progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, groups of Stonjourner gather from all over to form an evenly spaced ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories involving the position of the sun, the earth's energy, and other factors.[1] Another curiosity is that the elemental composition of the rocks that form Stonjourner's body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from its native habitat. Stonjourner primarily makes its home in grasslands. Stonjourner is the only known Pokémon that can have Power Spot as an Ability."
