    "descripcion": "Golbat is a large, blue, chiropteran Pokémon with purple wing membranes. It has small eyes with slit-like pupils, along with tiny triangular ears with purple insides, and a massive mouth with two fangs in each jaw. The fangs are smaller on a female Golbat. While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, Golbat occasionally displays a long, purple tongue. It has short legs with long, tiny feet. Despite this, Golbat can walk skillfully on the ground. Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pokémon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way. Golbat is nocturnal and can be found quite easily in caves."
