    "descripcion": "Rabsca is a teal, metallic, beetle-like Pok√©mon that perpetually floats upside down in the air. Its face is red, with a diamond-shaped nose, a white four-pointed star on its forehead, and long, prominent white hairs that extend past its body, resembling eyebrows and a mustache; the latter also somewhat resembles wings. Its eyes have pink sclerae and white pupils shaped like four-pointed stars, but they are usually closed. It has four limbs, each with three spike-like protruberances. It has four horn-like protrusions on its head, a zigzag pattern on its abdomen, and an elaborate pattern of red stripes on its back. Rabsca's hind legs hold a ball over its body. The double-layer ball is reddish pink with purple cloud-like masses surrounding it, and it can glow brightly, revealing a cocoon-like infant sleeping inside. Rabsca gently rolls the ball with its legs so that the infant inside can sleep comfortably. A hypothesis posits that the infant is actually Rabsca's true body, since the body that rolls the ball around barely moves. In Generation IX, Speed Swap is its signature move."
