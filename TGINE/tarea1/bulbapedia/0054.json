    "descripcion": "Psyduck is a yellow Pokémon resembling a duck or a bipedal platypus. On top of its head are three thick strands of black hair, and it has a wide, flat cream-colored beak. Psyduck's eyes seem vacant and have tiny pupils. Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands. Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pokémon Snap. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps.[1] Very rarely, their sights are Psyduck sleeping peacefully while not holding its head. Prior to Generation V, Psyduck and its evolved form, Golduck, were the only known Pokémon that could have Cloud Nine as an Ability."
