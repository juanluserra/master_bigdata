    "pokemon": "Purrloin",
    "pokedex_number": "0509",
    "origin": "Purrloin appears to be based on a tuxedo cat. Its fur pattern, behavior, and feline influence suggest that it may also be based on a female thief, commonly known as a cat burglar.",
    "description": "Purrloin is a primarily purple, feline Pokémon. Its head has tufted fur on its ears and cheeks. There are long, tapered violet markings above its green eyes. It has a diminutive black nose on its creamy muzzle, and a small, oval, cream-colored marking above each eye. Its neck, shoulders, back, and hind paws are also cream-colored. The tip of its tail has a curved, vaguely scythe-like extension. Purrloin is a quadrupedal Pokémon, but it can stand and walk on its hind legs as well. Purrloin is a mischievous Pokémon that likes to steal from people. Purrloin feels amusement from the frustration of those it steals from. It will put on a cute act in order to get its victims to let their guard down. Should this facade succeed, the victim is left with stinging scratches and broken pride from Purrloin's laughter. However, it is often forgiven even if it is caught stealing due to its charm. When angered, it fights back with its claws. In Galar, Purrloin has a fierce rivalry with Nickit."
