    "descripcion": "Lechonk is a stout Pokémon resembling a hog. Its body is almost entirely grayish black, except for the brown colorations on its face and ears, and the yellow growths under its eyes that resemble teardrops. Its ears are droopy with yellow insides, and they partially cover its eyes. It has a triangular pink snout with two huge oval nostrils as well as stubby feet ending in pink hooves. Its tail is short and curled. Lechonk has an excellent sense of smell, which it uses to find fragrant wild grasses and rich Berries to eat. This diet causes it to emanate a herbal body odor that repels bug Pokémon.[1] Lechonk is also known to feed on the sweet nectar on Appletun's back. Lechonk has a timid and faint-hearted temperament, and will panic and charge forward if attacked or startled by an opponent. Despite its apparent bulk, Lechonk's body mainly consists not of fat but of muscle, built up by its habit of walking around to find food.[1] Some Trainers use Lechonk to look for cooking ingredients, such as detached Crabominable pincers scattered on mountains. As seen in the anime, Lechonk will become hostile towards trainers carrying groceries or meals and attack them for their food."
