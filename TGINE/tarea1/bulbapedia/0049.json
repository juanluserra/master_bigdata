    "pokemon": "Venomoth",
    "pokedex_number": "0049",
    "origin": "Venomoth seems to be based on swallowtail moths, many of which are toxic. Its face and insect diet suggest that it may also draw inspiration from lacewings, which, like many moths, are attracted to lights at night. Specifically, it may be a play on moth lacewing (family Ithonidae).",
    "description": "Venomoth is a lepidopteran insect Pokémon whose body is varying shades of purple. Its head and thorax are both light purple, and it has bulbous, round, light blue eyes, a small mandible, and a three-point crest on its head. Tucked close to its thorax are three pairs of tiny, whitish legs. Its abdomen is paler with several black, zigzagging stripes encircling it. It has two pairs of pale purple moth-like wings with thin black venation. Its official artwork and various TCG cards depict the wings as translucent.[1] Venomoth's wings are covered in dust-like scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings and leak out poison once they make contact with the skin. Venomoth lives in dense temperate forests with thick undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pokémon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt for its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light sources, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself. As stated in the third chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Venomoth has a short lifespan."
