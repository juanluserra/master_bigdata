    "descripcion": "Chandelure is a Pok√©mon that resembles a sentient chandelier. It has a striped, round head, and round, pupil-less yellow eyes. There is a ring of small, black spikes on top of its head with a tall, purple flame in the middle. From a black spike below its head, black arms curl upward. These arms are tipped with purple fire. Chandelure's flames do not burn their victims physically; rather, they burn the victim's spirit. After hypnotizing its opponent by waving these flames, it absorbs the victim's spirit. It is said that any spirits that get incinerated by Chandelure's flames end up losing their way and are forced to wander the mortal world forever. Chandelure is known to reside in rundown mansions. There is a rumor that funerals were a constant occurrence for people that lived in homes that were illuminated by Chandelure in place of lights."
