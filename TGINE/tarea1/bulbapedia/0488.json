    "descripcion": "Cresselia is a Pokémon that has a blue, swan-like body with a yellow underside. It has pink eyes, a dark pink, round tuft on its head, and a pointed, beak-like snout. There are yellow, crescent-shaped ornaments on the sides of its head that merge in the back. It has a pointed, tail-like protrusion on its rear. Cresselia has glowing, pink, ring-like wings on its sides and back. The wings on its sides are solid dark pink, while the wing on its back is larger and consists of three shades of pink. These wings, especially its back wing, release shining particles and undulate beautifully around the quarter moon. It has paw-like protrusions resting on its chest. Cresselia generally floats in the air, but may rest on the floor when it is injured. Due to its appearance, Cresselia is said to resemble a crescent moon and the woman who made the Milky Way. Cresselia has the power to dispel nightmares, and holding one of its feathers is said to bring happy dreams. It is also great at recovery and healing techniques. Cresselia can unleash spores in the air to cause confusion on opponents while forming a shield to defend itself at the same time. Its relationship to its counterpart, Darkrai, can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen in Sleepless In Pre-Battle! and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky, or cooperative, as seen in Nightfall? Nightmares! and A Midsummer Night's Light!. It tends to reside on an island or mountain that has a Darkrai nearby in order to keep an eye on it. Cresselia is a female-only species. Cresselia is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Lunar Dance and Lunar Blessing."
