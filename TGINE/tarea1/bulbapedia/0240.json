    "pokedex_number": "0240",
    "origin": "Magby seems to be a combination of a booby or duck with a mythical salamander. It may also be based on a Karura, depicted in Japanese Hindu-Buddhist mythology as a birdlike, fire-breathing creature. The spike on its back gives it a resemblance to a baby iguana. Its face may also be based on Hyottoko masks, which resemble a man blowing fire through a bamboo pipe. The yellow part on its belly appears to be a symbol of a flame.",
    "description": "Magby is a bipedal Pokémon that has a red body with a yellow, flame-shaped marking on its stomach and a black collar marking on its neck. Its head is covered with large lumps, and it has a rounded, yellow beak. There is a single spike on its back and it has a tapered tail. Its short arms have three clawed fingers, while its feet have only two clawed toes. Magby can breathe 1100 °F (600 °C) flames, and hot embers drip from its mouth. Its health can be determined by these flames; yellow flames show that a Magby is in good health, while flames mixed with a lot of smoke is symptomatic of fatigue, and flames dripping from its nose is a sign of a cold. Magby's volcanic habitat ensures its health. However, it can be seen living in towns. Magby is known to be rather small and timid. It leaks out flames when excited or surprised. It prefers to soak in the magma of volcanoes in order to recover from the day's fatigue."
