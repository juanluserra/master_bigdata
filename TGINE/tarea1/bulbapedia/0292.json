    "descripcion": "Shedinja is a Pokémon resembling a cicada's shed exoskeleton. Most of its body is light brown, but the abdomen is gray. It has four protrusions on its underside instead of legs; the top pair is brown, while the lower is gray. There are round protrusions on the side of its head with narrow slits for eyes. Two lines encircle its abdomen and a white crescent-shaped halo floats above its head. On its back is a pair of tattered wings divided into three wingtips. A hole between its wings reveals that its body is completely hollow and dark, as it possesses no internal organs. Shedinja is said to be a very strange and peculiar Pokémon due to how it is created from an empty shell. It has the ability to inhabit an empty Poké Ball after it evolves from Nincada. It is said that looking into this empty space will steal one's spirit. Its shell is very hard, which gives it strong defense but renders it incapable of movement. It does not breathe and floats without moving its wings. It lives in tropical and temperate forests. Shedinja is the only known Pokémon that can have Wonder Guard as an Ability."
