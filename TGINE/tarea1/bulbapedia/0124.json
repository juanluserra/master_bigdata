    "descripcion": "Jynx is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon that resembles a woman. It has a purple face, pink lips, saucer-like eyes, and long blonde hair. It wears a red gown with two gold circlets on the chest. While the Pokémon the Series episode Stage Fight! showed it to possess feet, the games show only blackness under the dress, and it lacks a footprint. Despite this, it is able to learn the kicking move Triple Axel. It has white arms and five-fingered purple hands. Jynx is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Originally, its face was colored black. Pokémon Stadium's fainting animation had it disappear leaving only its hair behind, implying that what appears to be dark-colored skin is actually just darkness. Jynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements. In certain parts of Galar, it has been feared and worshiped while being called the \"Queen of Ice\". The Jynx in Galar are said to have beautiful and delicate voices and a fanbase dedicated to them. Jynx are able to extend their lips to kiss its opponent. Jynx often is found in urban areas. Jynx is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Lovely Kiss by leveling up."
