    "descripcion": "Flamigo is an avian Pokémon resembling a flamingo. It is mostly pink, with a rounded body and wings, and a long serpentine neck that's usually tied into a knot at the base. It is said that Flamigo ties its neck into a knot to keep the energy inside its belly from escaping. Flamigo also has tall thin white legs with webbed feet, a white face, a curved beak with a black tip, and yellow eyes with black pupils. Flamigo typically stands on one of its legs. Flamigo lives near bodies of water and in wetlands. Flocks of Flamigo are known to attack together in perfect harmony, via a behavior known as \"synchronizing\". Flamigo is the only known Pokémon that can have Costar as an Ability."
