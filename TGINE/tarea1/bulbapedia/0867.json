    "descripcion": "Runerigus is a Pokémon composed of an oblong, irregularly-shaped clay slab, with an outline of a stylized serpent with sharp teeth painted onto it in red. Two sections of the slab at the upper left and upper right side, along with a piece bearing the serpent's head and a small piece bearing the tip of the image's tail, have broken off and are held in place by shadowy black tendrils that form its arms, neck, and tail respectively; the \"tail\" fragment also resembles the piece carried by Galarian Yamask. It has five black fingers on each hand, which extend from the ends of the fragments forming its arms. It has a single purple eye located in the same spot as the painting's eye. Runerigus seems to be distantly related to Cofagrigus. Runerigus was formed from a painting imbued with an ancient curse, which was activated by absorbing the spirit of a Yamask and brought the painting to life. Anyone that touches its shadowy body will have the memories behind its painting's creation forced onto them. Runerigus and its pre-Evolution, Galarian Yamask, are the only known Pokémon that can have Wandering Spirit as an Ability."
