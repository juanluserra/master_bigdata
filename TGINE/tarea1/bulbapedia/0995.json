    "pokemon": "Iron Thorns",
    "pokedex_number": "0995",
    "origin": "Iron Thorns is based on Tyranitar, and by extension, the idea of kaiju, specifically mecha kaiju. It may also be a reference to the Big Monster Series of movies from Pokémon Black 2 and White 2's Pokéstar Studios, which feature mechanical versions of Tyranitar.",
    "description": "Iron Thorns is a large, bipedal, robotic dinosaur-like Pokémon with green metallic armor plating covering its body and limbs. Its claws, lower jaw, parts of its abdomen, and tail tip are black. Part of its torso and legs seem to be transparent, revealing a glowing green substance of some sort. On its back are retractable spikes made of the same substance. According to an article from a June issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Thorns has been sighted in a certain cave in Paldea. It bears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, although it is said to be coolheaded and prefers to avoid unnecessary fights. It appears to be highly intelligent and is speculated to be a Tyranitar as it would appear a billion years in the future. Its name is said to come from a similarly described entity appearing in the Violet Book. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the green energy on its torso, legs, tail and spikes to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Thorns is an future Pokémon related to Tyranitar. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Thorns is a counterpart of Tyranitar from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Thorns were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago."
