    "descripcion": "Glimmet is a crystal plant-like Pokémon. It has a light purple body shaped like the stem of a plant, and its face is black with bright yellow eyes covered by a transparent cone. It has six dark blue crystal petals with light blue lines each around the head. The minerals inside of these petals are filled with crystallized poison. Glimmet's diet consists of absorbing minerals from the walls of caves and Terastal energy. Glimmet is capable of floating to travel. To defend itself from foes, Glimmet scatters poisonous powder from its petals. It may have a connection to the Terastal phenomenon, though this is not confirmed; its Evolution's petals resemble the Tera Jewels that are seen when a Pokémon Terastallizes, many Glimmet (along with its Evolution) can also be found in Area Zero and the Area Zero Underdepths, the place where the Terastal phenomenon originated, and eight Glimmet Crystals are needed to make TM171 (Tera Blast), a move that changes type with Terastallizing. Glimmet has also been seen at Kitakami, specifically the Crystal Pool, where there are Terastal crystals at the bottom of the lake. In Pokémon Horizons: The Series, it is revealed that Glimmet can propel itself faster through the air by spinning its petals like a propeller. Glimmet and its evolved form, Glimmora, are the only known Pokémon that can have Toxic Debris as an Ability."
