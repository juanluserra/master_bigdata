    "origin": "Metang is made of two Beldum merged. Aside from that, it may be based on flying saucers and crabs.",
    "description": "Metang is a robotic Pokémon with teal, metallic skin. It has a disc-shaped body with a pair of flat, gray spikes on either side toward the rear. A jet cannot scratch Metang due to its strong body. There is a gray spike in the middle of its face, similar to a nose. A pair of red eyes reside in two holes in its metallic skin. While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint. Metang is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pokémon. This linkage allows Metang to generate a strong, psychokinetic power that is doubled. However, this does not increase its intellect. This Pokémon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph (100 km/h) in search of prey. When Metang finds its prey, it uses its psychic power to stop it from escaping. Then it firmly grabs onto the prey with its claws, never letting go. Metang's claws are able to rip through steel. This Pokémon lives on rough terrains and harsh mountains. It pursues Nosepass, loving its magnetic minerals."
