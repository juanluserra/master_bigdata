    "description": "Dwebble is a small, orange, hermit crab-like Pok√©mon with large pincers. It has dark, oval-shaped eyes supported by eye stalks. It has a hook-like tail that is concealed underneath the sectioned chunk of gray rock it uses as a shell. It ties with Minior and Carbink as the shortest Rock-type. When finding a rock to use as its shell, Dwebble inspects the rock to see if it can be used, then it digs a hole in the rock's bottom. It can expel a corrosive spray from its mouth to help it carve such a hole, or to mend its shell. If the rock breaks, Dwebble won't calm down until it can find a replacement. Its search for suitable rocks makes it a natural enemy of Roggenrola and Rolycoly. If it can't find a livable rock, it moves into the ports of a Hippowdon, where it dislodges any stuck stones; in return, the Hippowdon looks after the homeless Dwebble."
