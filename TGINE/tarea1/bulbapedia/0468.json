    "descripcion": "Togekiss is a white, avian Pok√©mon with an ovoid body. While its feet are small and situated closely together, its wings are broad and triangular. Red and blue triangular markings over its underside, and it has a short tail consisting of three feathers. On the back of its head are three spikes: a red-tipped one on the right, a blue-tipped one on the left, and a pure white one in the middle. Togekiss has a relatively flat face and small, black eyes. Togekiss have long been known worldwide as bringers of blessings, being depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times. It is said that Togekiss brings good luck simply by virtue of its existence. However, they only appear in peaceful places and have never been witnessed anywhere near conflict or turmoil, making their recent sightings exceptionally rare. It shares many kind gifts and sweet blessings when it visits peaceful places or sees people who avoid strife and respect the rights of others. However, Togekiss is a capable fighter, and can use a powerful energy wave in battle. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, seeing several Togekiss sleeping contently is a sign that peace reigns in the area."
