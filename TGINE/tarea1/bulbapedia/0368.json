    "pokemon": "Gorebyss",
    "pokedex_number": "0368",
    "origin": "Gorebyss may have been based on the snipe eel. It also resembles a pipefish as well as an oarfish and a chimaera. The feminine aspects, shell bra, and tail of Gorebyss are reminiscent of mermaids. The shell might be the remains from its previous form, Clamperl.",
    "description": "Gorebyss is a pink, serpentine Pokémon with a long, thin mouth. This pointed mouth is used to stab prey and drain their body fluids. However, it has also been known to feed on seaweed that grows between stones. Its pink skin becomes brighter in the spring and after it has fed. Its body color changes with water temperature, with Gorebyss found in Alola having blindingly vivid coloration. A long, purple-tipped fin extends from the top of its head, and there is a thin, pointed fin extending beneath its head. There are two purple shells on its chest, causing it to somewhat resemble a mermaid. The tail has a purple, circular fin at the tip, and two white bands near its base. This Pokémon's body is durable enough to withstand high-pressure levels in the deep sea, where it lives. Additionally, this adaptation allows it to withstand powerful attacks."
