    "descripcion": "Cherrim is a small Pokémon with two different forms, both of which are dependent on the weather. During normal weather conditions, Cherrim is in its Overcast Form. Two purple petals enclose its deep pink body. A short purple stem and a green leafy sepal sprout from the top of the petals. Its eyes appear to be near its short legs in this form. Cherrim waits quietly as a bud for a ray of sunlight. When it is hit with strong sunlight, it blooms and absorbs the rays with its entire body. It quickly changes from quiet to excitable and active. It will attempt to make up for everything it was forced to endure as a bud while the sunlight lasts. Once the light is gone, Cherrim folds back into a bud. Bug Pokémon are often seen gathering around Cherrim due to being drawn in by the scent released from its petals. Cherrim is the only known Pokémon that can have Flower Gift as an Ability."
