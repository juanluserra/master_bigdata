    "pokemon": "Sawk",
    "pokedex_number": "0539",
    "origin": "According to interviews with Ken Sugimori in Nintendo Dream, Sawk is based on a karateka (a karate practitioner).[1]",
    "description": "Sawk is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon with a lean, blue body and rocky skin. Its head is oblong-like and low on its shoulders, with an ornate sideways z-shaped black feature that forms its nose and its left brow. Its hands and feet each have three digits, with its feet and toes coming to a sharp point. It wears a light blue karate gi with a black, v-neck collar that extends down to its black belt. Sawk will tie this black belt to increase its power. The gi has an intricate diamond pattern on its sleeves and a black, square patch on the bend of its knees. Sawk is found secluded in the mountains where it trains to increase its strength. It becomes angered if it is interrupted while training. A Sawk that has trained to its fullest potential has enough power to cleave oceans with a single karate chop. This Pokémon is an all male species with no female counterpart."
