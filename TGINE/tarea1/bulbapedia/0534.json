    "pokedex_number": "0534",
    "origin": "At first glance, Conkeldurr's brutal humanoid appearance suggests inspiration from ogres of European folklore. Timburr's Pokédex entry supports that it and its evolved forms are based on construction workers. Conkeldurr in particular is always holding two concrete pillars. Its body appears to be covered with swollen veins from physical labor. Due to its clown nose and buff body, it may have also been based on a muscleman carny from a carnival sideshow. It also seems to be based on an elderly person since it has a gray tuft under its chin and uses its pillars as walking canes. A red nose is also given to some anime characters, commonly shown on many older men.",
    "description": "Conkeldurr is a bipedal sepia-colored Pokémon resembling an ogre. Its nose is large and red, with its face also having a prominent brow, a wide mouth, a gray tuft on its chin, dark rings around its eyes, and a bulbous feature sticking up from the back of its head. Thick violet bands and tendons adorn its shoulders, chest, back, and thighs. It is known to carry concrete pillars in its massive arms, which it uses to attack strongly without using physical strength or to support its massive upper body. However, when it goes all out, it will throw its pillars aside and jump at opponents to beat them with its fists. Conkeldurr can create concrete, a technique it was believed to have taught humans 2,000 years ago. Concrete that Conkeldurr has mixed is more durable than standard concrete, even when both forms of concrete have the same composition. It is often seen around construction sites, helping construction workers."
