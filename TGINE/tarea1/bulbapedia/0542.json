    "descripcion": "Leavanny is a thin, yellow, bipedal insectoid Pokémon that resembles a leaf cutter ant. It has a broad, split-leaf around its large, round head and it has long antennae that end in semicircles. Its eyes are red with no apparent sclerae. Its tiny thorax is dark green, and its long abdomen is yellow and covered in a green leaf. Its hands are long and leaf-like with a \"bite\" taken out of each. Its upper arms are also leaf-like but with a vein of yellow at the top. Its hips are wide and Its slender legs are yellow with dark green, thick segments around its thighs, making them appear armored. Leavanny's arm blades are powerful enough to slice through a tree trunk with a single swing. It generally lives in forests. Leavanny is very parental and uses its cutters and the sticky silk it produces to create clothing made of leaves for small Pokémon. Leavanny is known to make warm wrappings for young Sewaddle. It also warms its eggs with fermenting fallen leaves. While usually gentle, it will attack anyone or anything that harms young Pokémon."
