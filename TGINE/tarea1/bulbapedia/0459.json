    "descripcion": "Snover is a Pokémon with a white upper body and brown lower body that resembles a snow-covered tree. It will be two-thirds brown if male and two-thirds white if female. It has green eyes and three points on top of its head. Its feet and green tail are stubby, and there are two green spikes that resemble pinecones on its back. Five cones form its hand: a large central cone with four smaller cones around it. Edible white Berries grow along Snover's midsection. It usually grows the berries when spring approaches. In Galar, packs of its natural predator, Galarian Darumaka, enjoy eating the Berries produced by Snover. This results in Abomasnow often chasing them away in order to protect it. Snover lives on snowy peaks in warm seasons but migrates lower as the weather cools. A curious Pokémon, it often approaches people and can be found inspecting footprints in the snow. There are stories of Snover visiting human settlements, often bonding with the children there. Snover can sink its feet into the snow to absorb water, this helps cool down its body temperature. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Pokémon tend to sneak upon the sleeping Snover to consume the berries it grows. Snover is unaware of this while it sleeps. Prior to Generation VI, Snover and its evolved form, Abomasnow, were the only known Pokémon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability."
