    "descripcion": "Morgrem is a somewhat humanoid Pokémon, with a magenta upper body and a light green lower body divided by a zig-zag line. It has long, lanky arms with hands that have three sharp fingers, and round feet that have three toes. Just like its pre-Evolution, Morgrem has prominently large ears and eyes, long white fangs, a purple tongue, and an upturned nose with a single nostril. However, Morgrem's pupils are red instead of black, and its nose is longer. Morgrem has long, black hair with a bang that covers its left eye; the end of the hair is shaped like a pole arm. Morgrem lacks confidence in its physical strength, so it makes up for it with cunning and dirty tactics. It feigns surrender by going down on all fours to lure its opponents, before it stabs them with its hair. It tends to lure people into the woods where it lives. Like Impidimp, Morgrem feeds on negative emotions. Some people believe that Morgrem has the ability to make crops grow. Morgrem is very popular with people who have gloomy thoughts. Morgrem and its evolutionary relatives are male-only species. Morgrem and its evolved form, Grimmsnarl, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move False Surrender. In Generation IX, Confide is also one of its signature moves."
