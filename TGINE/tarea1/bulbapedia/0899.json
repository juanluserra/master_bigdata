    "descripcion": "Wyrdeer is a snow deer-like Pokémon. Its body is mostly gray with white spots, as well as white fur on its lower legs, underside, round tail, eyebrows, and mane, the latter resembling a beard. Wyrdeer has large, golden antlers, the shape of which resembles radio antennae. Each of these antlers has one black orb near the base. Wyrdeer also has a brown nose and black cloven hooves, as well as two tufts of fur on the back of each lower leg. Wyrdeer is well-beloved by the people in the Hisui region due to its highly prized fur, which provides excellent insulation from the cold and is used to make clothing. By using the orbs on its antlers, Wyrdeer can unleash psychic powers strong enough to distort space, and also create invisible barriers for protection. It also uses the antlers to lead Stantler herds and search for safe paths to travel.[1] Wyrdeer's sturdy legs allow it to gallop and dash across the land, and jump over any obstacle in its way. Wyrdeer is implied to be extinct in the present day, Stantler are said to be no longer capable of evolving into Wyrdeer and they're not known to be found anywhere. A special Wyrdeer is also worshiped due to being descended from one of the ten ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from Arceus and serves as a Ride Pokémon. The people in Hisui use the Celestica Flute to call for his aid. He resides in the Obsidian Fieldlands, watched over by the warden Mai. Wyrdeer and its pre-evolved form, Stantler, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Psyshield Bash."
