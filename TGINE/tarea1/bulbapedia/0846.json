    "descripcion": "Arrokuda is a brown and tan fish Pokémon resembling a barracuda. It has two big black eyes and two small jaws pointing upward, the latter of which it is very proud of. It also has five fins scattered on its body; two pelvic fins, two anal fins, and one dorsal fin. This Pokémon has two red spots, one behind each jaw, as well as three white scales on each side of its body for a total of six. Arrokuda lastly has three back fins on its tail resembling a ship propeller, starting off tan in color, but having a brown coloring on the end. Cramorant is the natural predator of Arrokuda, and they grab Arrokuda in their mouth in battle if using Surf or Dive. Cramorant tend to spit out Arrokuda when attacked, however, causing the Rush Pokémon to fly out and smack nearby opponents. In Paldea, Wattrel is Arrokuda's predator. Arrokuda can only swim in a straight line. Should Arrokuda see any movement near it, it will charge ahead using its sharp pointed jaws; however, its poor eyesight causes it to miss frequently. Its movements also tend to become sluggish when it eats too much, which is typically when Cramorant and Wattrel appear to swallow it up. Arrokuda and its evolution, Barraskewda, are the only known Pokémon that can have Propeller Tail as an Ability."
