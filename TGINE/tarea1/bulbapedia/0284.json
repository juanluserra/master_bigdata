    "pokemon": "Masquerain",
    "pokedex_number": "0284",
    "origin": "Masquerain seems to be based on a variety of insects. Although rarely shown, it apparently has the ability to walk on the surface of water using its wings as if they were legs, so it may be based on a water strider. Its Japanese name suggests inspiration from moths, many of which use eyespots to frighten would-be predators. Masquerain's eyespots, in particular, form a pattern similar to a mask or a cat face. Masquerain's habitat, translucent wings, hovering flight pattern, and its transformation from the Water-type Surskit to a Flying-type are reminiscent of dragonflies and damselflies. Its raindrop-shaped head resembles some lanternflies.",
    "description": "Masquerain is a light blue insectoid Pokémon with two pairs of rhombus-shaped wings on each side of its body. Its head is shaped like an elongated teardrop with a pink face and round, black eyes. On either side of its head is a large antenna that resembles an angry eye. The antennae are white with pink along the lower rim. White lines along the rim resemble eyelashes, while a large, dark pink dot in the middle represents the pupil or iris. These eyespots are used to intimidate enemies. Masquerain's four wings allow it to fly in any direction and hover, but it cannot fly when its wings are wet. As shown in its official artwork and the TCG, the wings are translucent. Additionally, rainy weather causes its antennae to become heavy and droop. In order to protect its wings and antennae, this Pokémon will shelter under trees or the eaves of houses. Masquerain lives on water's edge."
