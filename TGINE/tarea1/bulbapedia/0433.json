    "origin": "Chingling is based on a 鈴 Suzu bell, which is used at Shinto shrines.",
    "description": "Chingling is a yellow, spherical Pokémon similar to a jingle bell. It has stubby arms and legs, as well as beady, black eyes. There are circular openings on both sides of its mouth. Inside its mouth is a red orb, which creates a ringing sound as the Pokémon moves. Additionally, the orb can be vibrated to create high-frequency, long-lasting cries to deafen its opponents. The sounds produced can be too high for people to hear, yet powerful enough to give them headaches. Atop its body is ring-like growth with a striped rope through the middle. The rope is red-and-white with short tassels on the ends."
