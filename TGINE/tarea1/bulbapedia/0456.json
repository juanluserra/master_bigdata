    "descripcion": "Finneon is a small fishlike Pok√©mon with an ellipsoid body. The bottom half of its body is light-blue while the top half is black. A pink stripe runs across either side of Finneon's horizontal length. It has small blue pectoral fins, two black oval-shaped dorsal fins, and pink eyes. Finneon's most notable feature is the pair of caudal fins that resemble a pair of blue butterfly wings with pink spots. The bottom lobes of a female Finneon's tail fin are bigger than a male's. Finneon's pink stripes and spots can absorb sunlight, which allows those areas to shine vividly at night. Finneon shines itself as a form of camouflage, as well as to attract prey. Because of its wing-like fins and beautiful appearance, Finneon is known as \"The Beautifly of the Sea\" and \"finery fish\". It lives in bodies of water, and it travels in schools, sometimes with Lumineon. Finneon is popular with divers; as a result, it is found living near resorts that feed them. It swims near the surface during the day to absorb sunlight, then dives into deeper waters at night. It is able to jump high and breach the water's surface with its tail fins, where it is then caught by its natural predator Wingull."
