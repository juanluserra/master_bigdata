    "pokemon": "Ursaluna",
    "pokedex_number": "0901",
    "origin": "Ursaluna may be based on the Ussuri brown bear, a subspecies of the brown bear native to Hokkaido (on which Hisui is based) and its surrounding areas. Its mountain-like body shape and Ground type may refer to Kim-un-kamuy, the Ainu god of bears and mountains, or the fact that Ussuri brown bears mostly live inside burrows excavated into hillsides. Its affinity with peat may be inspired by the real distribution of Ussuri brown bears around former coal mines like Yubetsu, Akan-chō. The pattern on its head evokes the image of a full moon shining through clouds.",
    "description": "Ursaluna is a large, quadrupedal dark brown bearlike Pokémon with a gray pelt around its large, humped back, paws, and round tail. The pelt has nine rectangular brown spikes on its back and four rectangular spikes on each side of its head. The front paws have five claws each while the back paws have three claws. Its face has a light-yellow circle resembling a full moon on the forehead, two gray eyebrows resembling clouds, and a light yellow snout that contains a small, black nose and sharp canine teeth. Ursaluna's Evolution is believed to have been triggered by Ursaring being exposed to the swampy terrain of the Hisui region during a full moon. Ursaluna's physique allows it to travel through the swamps with ease, and it can also manipulate peat to its advantage. Ursaluna are known to be good at searching for items, and even missing persons, using their sense of smell. A special Ursaluna is worshipped in Hisui for being a descendant of the ten ancient Pokémon blessed by Arceus. It is one of the Ride Pokémon who resides in Crimson Mirelands, watched over by the warden Calaba. This special Ursaluna is known to assist humans."
