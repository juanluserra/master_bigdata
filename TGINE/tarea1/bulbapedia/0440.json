    "descripcion": "Happiny is a small Pokémon that is shaped like an egg. It has a soft, smooth, light pink body. On top of its head is a curly outgrowth that resembles a ponytail, with a dark pink band around the base. The appearance of this curly growth of hair often annoys Happiny. It has three round bumps on its forehead and two pink circles on its cheeks. There is a pouch around the lower half of its body. The pouch is red with a white stripe around the top. Happiny's pouch is rubbery and flexible, enabling the Happiny to put things into it with ease. As it cannot produce Eggs yet, it makes up for it by carrying something round and white in its pouch to imitate Chansey and Blissey, typically an Egg-shaped stone. Happiny highly treasures this stone. It may give this stone to people whom it likes, however, it can throw a tantrum and cry should the stone be taken from it or not returned to it. The object it decides to carry may be too large, stopping this Pokémon from moving. It has a habit of wandering around people's feet and causing them to stumble. Happiny enjoys playing with children, often playing a game of House with them. Happiny is shown to be extremely strong in the animated series, as one has been seen lifting heavy things above its head. Happiny is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Happiny and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Soft-Boiled by leveling up."
