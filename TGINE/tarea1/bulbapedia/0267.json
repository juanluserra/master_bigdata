    "descripcion": "Beautifly is a butterfly-like Pokémon easily recognizable by its two pairs of colorful wings. It has large blue eyes and black antennae with rounded tips. Its face, underside, and four stubby limbs are gray, while the rest of its body is black. The main body of its wings are black with large, yellow markings, and smaller red and blue markings. The upper pair of wings are larger and have a line of yellow along the top edge, while each of the lower wings has a long, round-tipped extension on the bottom. The female's wings have smaller red spots than the male's. Beautifly has a long and curled black proboscis that it uses to gather pollen and nectar — its favorite food — from flowers. Its diet also includes water, fruit juices, and bodily fluids from its prey, all of which it sucks up with its proboscis. Despite its appearance, Beautifly is known to be aggressive and greedy; it will jab at foes with its proboscis if it is disturbed while collecting pollen. The preferred habitats of a Beautifly are forests, where it rides the spring winds while searching for pollen. It competes with Combee for nectar."
