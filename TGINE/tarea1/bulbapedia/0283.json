    "pokemon": "Surskit",
    "pokedex_number": "0283",
    "origin": "Surskit seems to be based on a water strider. The shape of its body is reminiscent of a curling stone, which slides across ice similarly to how Surskit can slide across the surface of water.",
    "description": "Surskit is a blue insectoid Pokémon. There are semicircular pink markings under its dark, circular eyes. It has a round body with four long, skinny legs extending from it. On top of its head is a yellow cap with a single antenna that secretes a thick, sugary syrup or a sweet scent. The syrup is exuded as a defense mechanism, while the scent can attract prey. This Pokémon can also secrete oil from the tips of its feet, which enables it to walk on water as though skating. Surskit inhabits ponds, rivers, and similar wetlands, where it feeds on microscopic, aquatic organisms. It's also known to appear in puddles after rainstorms. In its natural habitat, Surskit has been known to compete with Dewpider over food."
