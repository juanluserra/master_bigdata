    "descripcion": "Uxie is a small, gray, fairy-like Pokémon with two gray tails that are each encrusted with a red gem. Uxie has a partially yellow face with another red gem encrusted into its forehead. Its head faintly resembles that of a helmet or a human brain.\nUxie always has its eyes closed, as it can wipe out the memory of those who see its eyes. Uxie is both feared and respected for its ability to erase the memories of evil people. Uxie's spirit can leave its body without dying, and return at will. It created all knowledge in the Pokémon universe. Notably, when Uxie first emerged, humans gained the knowledge needed to solve problems and improved their quality of life. In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, it is shown that Uxie can create an illusion. It was also shown in The Needs of the Three! and The Battle Finale of Legend! to teleport itself, as well as other Pokémon and humans. Though it is very shy, Uxie will attack with force if it or its friends are threatened. In the past, it has been referred to as the \"Being of Knowledge\" due to its role in giving humans the ability to adapt and learn as life goes on. Alongside the other lake guardians, Uxie is needed for the creation of a Red Chain. Either through gems extracted from its body or through its claw. Together they're also capable of destroying a Red Chain. They even have the power to calm down Dialga and Palkia should the deities be enraged, but not both at once. Uxie lives in Lake Acuity, specifically in the Acuity Cavern at the center of the lake, thus gaining the title Lake Guardian. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Uxie is shown to be capable of speaking the human language via telepathy. . Uxie and the other lake guardians are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Mystical Power."
