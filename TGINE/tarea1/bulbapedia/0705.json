    "descripcion": "Sliggoo is a Pokémon that resembles a snail. The lower half of its body is light purple, while the upper half is a paler purple. It has featureless, green eyes, a single, tiny eyelash over each eye, and two pale green spots on each cheek. It has nubby, underdeveloped arms. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the front horns are small nubs, while the hind horns are considerably longer. Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain, heart, and other organs. Sliggoo excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells. Sliggoo only cares about food and will flee from its enemies whenever possible. Prior to Generation IX, Sliggoo and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability."
