    "descripcion": "Dreepy is a small, green Pokémon resembling a reptile or amphibian. Its head is a darker green, with yellow eyes, pink eyelids and gills, and large horns tipped with pink. Its serpentine body has two long front limbs, as well as a darker green stripe near its tail with three fins surrounding it. Dreepy are reborn ghosts of a prehistoric species that once lived in ancient seas. It generally retains the same behaviors it had when it was alive, as it tends to wander the locations where it once lived, as well as biting at Clauncher as if to eat them. Dreepy are exceptionally weak in combat, so much that on its own, a mere child could defeat it. However, it has the potential to become much stronger and evolve if it has friends to help it train. In the evening, groups of Dreepy fly at high speeds across the seas, poking at other Pokémon underwater for fun. Dreepy can often be seen fighting alongside its evolutionary relatives Drakloak and Dragapult. The former takes care of Dreepy until it evolves, while the latter is known to launch Dreepy at Mach speeds, which the Dreepy enjoy."
