    "descripcion": "Graveler is a bipedal, boulder Pokémon. Its round body is covered with small bumps and it has a rocky crest above its small eyes and mouth. It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pokémon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float. Graveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces, and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping.[1] It is believed that Graveler is dreaming about rolling down hilly paths."
