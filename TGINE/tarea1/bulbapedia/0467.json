    "descripcion": "Magmortar is a large, vaguely humanoid, red-and-yellow-striped Pokémon with an egg-shaped body. It has pink lips on its dark face. It has yellow, tubular arms with a black \"band\" on both and three small claws on the black part of each \"hand\". Its legs are small in proportion to its body with pink thighs, red feet, and black shackles around its ankles. It has one large yellow flame on its head, as well as large red flames on its shoulders and tail. Additionally, it has four pink spikes on its back. It has an organ that resembles a magma chamber. When Magmortar prepares to shoot fire from its hands, its claws are capable of disappearing into its skin, forming a pressurized cannon. It blasts fireballs of over 3,600 °F (2,000 °C), easily melting through iron and burning foes to a blackened crisp, although Magmortar avoids this method when hunting prey. Magmortar increases its body temperature by inhaling deeply, increasing the fire burning with its belly. When firing, its body can turn into a whitish hue from the intense heat. Its arm starts melting when it fires a whole barrage. Magmortar is used in some factories in order to process metal. It lives in volcanic craters, with a single pair of male and female Magmortar occupying one."
