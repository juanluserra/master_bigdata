    "descripcion": "Helioptile is a bipedal, lizard-like Pokémon. It is primarily pale yellow with black feet and a black tail tip. The top of its head is also black with a triangular yellow marking on its forehead. It has blue eyes, a V-shaped mouth, a slightly pointed head, a tapering tail, and three toes on each foot. On either side of its head hangs a pointed, extension with a yellow tip. These can stiffen and expand into a frill. These frills have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. This allows it to create its own energy and thrive without food in its desert home. The frills act similar to solar panels and are the source of Helioptile's electric moves. However should this process get interrupted, Helioptile will be stressed to the point of weakness. As seen in one of its attack animations in the games, its head and frills glow with a pale yellow light when it uses certain moves. Prior to Generation VIII, Helioptile and its evolved form, Heliolisk, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electrify."
