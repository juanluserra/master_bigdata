    "descripcion": "Arctibax is a bluish gray theropod-like Pokémon, with a jagged light blue pattern on its underside, a medium-sized tail, and a large, triangular, dark gray dorsal fin on its back. Its eyes have yellow sclerae and black pupils, and it has three bluish-white claws on its hands and feet, along with long, thin, V-shaped orange quills on the backs of its hands. Arctibax is capable of freezing the surrounding air, forming an ice mask over its mouth and eyes — the latter resembling eyebrows — to protect itself. It also encases its dorsal fin in sharp ice spikes, forming a blade of ice. Arctibax has strong back and leg muscles, which allow it to do a front flip and attack opponents with its dorsal fin while airborne. It is rarely found in the wild, but may be sighted in certain caverns. Arctibax and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Thermal Exchange as an Ability."
