    "descripcion": "Fletchinder is an avian Pokémon with predominantly orange and black plumage. It has a sharp, black beak, black eyes with yellow, mask-like markings behind them, and a small, pointed crest on the back of its head. Its upper side is reddish-orange and its belly is gray. There is a flame pattern on its breast where the two colors meet. The tips and undersides of its pointed, black wings are yellow. Its legs are also black with sharp talons and two toes facing forward and one back. Two white, V-shaped markings are located near the tip of its long black tail-feathers. Its tail ends in two points and has another feather sticking out of the base on each side, resembling the fletching on the end of an arrow. Fletchinder has a flame sac in its belly. It hunts by igniting tall grass and swooping down on bug Pokémon that attempt to escape the blaze. Once captured, the prey is cooked before being consumed. As its internal fire gradually heats up, it can fly at increasingly faster speeds. It is aggressive and territorial, even against its own kind. It often fights with its own kind for the right to feeding grounds. Its territory range has a radius of over one mile, or around 2-3 km. Fletchinder and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Gale Wings as an Ability."
