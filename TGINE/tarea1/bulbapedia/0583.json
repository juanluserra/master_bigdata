    "descripcion": "Vanillish is a Pokémon with a large, white, rounded upper body with swirled snow on top, overall resembling a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a waffle cone. Its eyes are dark blue with small ice crystals at the sides. Vanillish has a dark blue mouth, two ice crystals below its mouth, and stubby limbs that resemble icicles. It has a pointed lower body that resembles a large icicle. Vanillish lives in southern, snowy mountains, which it migrated to during an ancient ice age. It creates ice inside its body by drinking water and then expels it to hide itself or freeze opponents. Its icy breath can reach temperatures of −148 °F (−100 °C). It can shatter frozen opponents with powerful headbutts. Vanillish are smaller in hotter regions, and although it can refreeze its body despite melting, this process can leave its appearance warped."
