    "descripcion": "Meltan is a small Pokémon with a silvery body of liquid metal. Its head is hard and resembles a golden hexagonal nut, with a small black sphere floating inside. This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. According to official concept arts, Meltan's liquid body is made of gallium, and it can cry gallium tears. Its arms can stretch to be longer or shorter.[1] Meltan is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with Alolan Diglett and Klefki as the shortest Steel-type Pokémon. Meltan's body can corrode various metals, which it feeds on by absorbing them. The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye.[2] According to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts in the same place the Mystery Box, was found. The Mystery Box was created by Melmetal's followers to store away the Meltan created after its death, until one day, they could create a new Melmetal. At the end of a Melmetal's life span, it'll rust and fall apart, however its shards will eventually be reborn as Meltan. It is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the rest of the group to evolve. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Show Me the Metal!, the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. Meltan can spin its head, creating a sound that calls others of its kind. Its head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection. In Got Meltan?, it's revealed that it can be tamed if fed metal-like treats. In Living on the Cutting Edge!, Meltan is shown multiplying in numbers overtime."
