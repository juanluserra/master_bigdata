    "pokedex_number": "0886",
    "origin": "Drakloak may be based on the Diplocaulus or Gerrothorax with elements taken from fighter aircraft and crossbows. It may also reference paternal care behavior present in many amphibian species.",
    "description": "Drakloak is a Pokémon which resembles a lizard, with a wide, black-colored head with two vertical horns and two pinkish-red triangle-shaped stripes on either side. It has yellow eyes with pink eyelids, while the underside of its mouth is light blue. The rest of its body is also light blue, while its belly is yellow with a red, upside-down V-shaped mark. It has short, stubby arms and legs and a long tail. Drakloak is capable of flying at speeds greater than 120 mph (200 km/h). It carries a Dreepy on its head, which it takes care of and fights alongside until the Dreepy manages to evolve. If it lacks a Dreepy to care for, it will become uneasy and desperately try to find any Pokémon to serve as a substitute to take care of. Drakloak attacks by firing energy blasts from its lungs. If it is defeated in battle, its Dreepy will wander off."
