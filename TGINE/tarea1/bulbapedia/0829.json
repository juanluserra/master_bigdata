    "pokemon": "Gossifleur",
    "pokedex_number": "0829",
    "origin": "Gossifleur is inspired by the cotton plant, specifically its flower. It is also based on a purported legend that Pokémon Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori had heard, of how catching cotton balls floating in the air may bring good luck.[2]",
    "description": "Gossifleur is a small, plantlike Pokémon with a large, yellow flower on its head. This flower covers most of its cream-colored head, which has a green stripe down its forehead and two yellow eyes with black sclerae. It has red, hair-like growths surrounding the back of its head and a green stem-like body. Gossifleur prefers living in lands with clean water and air. The pollen it produces has a healing effect, and it used to be made into a tea as a common folk remedy given to sick children in the Galar region. Gossifleur can travel long distances by riding the wind, controlling which direction it goes by twisting its body and petals.[1] While it travels, it starts to sing a joyous song that is said to charm many people into raising it. Gossifleur can anchor itself to the ground to bask in the sunlight. When it absorbs enough sunlight, it blooms brilliantly. Cutiefly are drawn in by Gossifleur's pollen. Gossifleur and its evolution, Eldegoss, are the only known Pokémon that can have Cotton Down as an Ability."
