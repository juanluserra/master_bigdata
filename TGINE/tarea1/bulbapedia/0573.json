    "descripcion": "Cinccino is a furry, gray, chinchilla-like Pokémon. It has large ears located to the sides of its head, with red insides partly covered by tufts of fur. Its eyes are large and brown, with a small, rounded nose. Its limbs are somewhat rounded and small, and its tail is long, fluffy, and incredibly white in color. Cinccino also has two large long fluffs on its head that wrap around its back. Cinccino uses its long fur as a scarf. Cinccino's fur is coated in a special oil that repels enemy attacks. Cinccino also uses this oil to coat its nest, protecting it from dust. The oil can also be used as a skin treatment, and is sold for a high price. Cinccino's fur feels amazing to touch, and it repels dust and prevents static electricity buildup. Prior to Generation VIII, Tail Slap was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
