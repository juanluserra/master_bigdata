    "descripcion": "In its Hero of Many Battles form, Zamazenta is a large magenta lupine Pokémon with yellow eyes, a bulky frame, and a ponytail on its head. Its tail and ponytail are a deep blue; it also has deep blue accents on its neck and forelimbs. There are battle scars on its shoulders, hips, side, and eye, which reveal a tan coloration under the red fur. Half of its right ear is also missing. Its head and neck have thick fur resembling a shield. It is believed to be the younger sibling or the rival of Zacian. In the past, Zamazenta was feared and respected by the people of Galar. 3000 years ago, It worked together with two young humans to save the region from Eternatus and the Darkest Day it created, defeating the Gigantic Pokémon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zacian in the Slumbering Weald. Zamazenta can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of Dynamaxing, Zamazenta may still go berserk when bombarded by Galar particles. As years passed, both Zamazenta and Zacian were forgotten by history, however, Professor Sonia proved their existence by writing her first book: \"Galar: A History\", which details the discovery she and the player had in Stow-on-Side. Zamazenta is also the only known Pokémon that can have Dauntless Shield as an Ability."
