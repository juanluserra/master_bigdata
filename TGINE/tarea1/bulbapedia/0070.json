    "descripcion": "Weepinbell is a pitcher plant Pokémon with a yellow, bell-shaped body. Above Weepinbell's circular eyes are three small green spots and a small, brown hook-shaped stem. It has wide, gaping mouth with pink lips. On each side of its body is a large, green leaf. Weepinbell camouflages itself as a plant in the forest whilst awaiting an unwary victim. When its prey draws near it sprays poison powder to immobilize the target before melting it with its internal acids. It oozes a neutralizing fluid that prevents these internal acids from melting its own body. It will also slice its prey too large to consume into pieces with its razor-sharp leaves. Weepinbell live in temperate forests and jungles where it hangs from tree branches by its stem to sleep. If it moves around during sleep, Weepinbell may slip and awaken to find itself on the ground. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Weepinbell is known to sometimes sleep undisturbed, even after falling down to the ground .[1]"
