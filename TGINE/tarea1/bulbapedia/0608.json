    "descripcion": "Lampent is a Pok√©mon which has a clear, spherical head containing a bluish-purple flame and oval, yellow eyes. On top of its head is a black covering, which resembles a lampshade, with a pointed spike on top. Underneath its head is a small, black body with a pointed spike at the bottom. Extending from its body are two long, wavy arms with no fingers. It floats through the air to move. Lampent can sense when someone is about to die, whom it visits and steals the spirit from the person's body. Though most often found in deep forests, it quietly wanders through cities and hangs around near hospitals to absorb the spirits of the fallen. It also pretends to be a lamp while in cities. Because of this, Lampent is feared as the emissary of death.  It uses the spirits it has absorbed to fuel its fire. On occasion, it has been known to work with Litwick to lead people to the Ghost World while stealing life energy."
