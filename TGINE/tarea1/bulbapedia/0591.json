    "descripcion": "Amoonguss is a mushroom-like Pokémon. It has a huge, gray, stem-like body; fierce-looking eyes; a tiny mouth with large pink lips; and two arms. It has large caps on its head and arms that resemble Poké Balls. The cap on its head has a few warts. Amoonguss is a carnivore, and uses the Poké Ball-like patterns on its arms to lure in prey, although it doesn't work too well in most cases. It also blows poisonous spores at its opponents. These spores can grow into mushrooms wherever they land if they are not washed off quickly. Amoonguss rarely moves, preferring to stand near any dropped Poké Balls. Amoonguss prefers damp places, and can be found mainly in long grass with only their mushroom cap head protruding from it, generally close to water. Brute Bonnet bears a resemblance to Amoonguss."
