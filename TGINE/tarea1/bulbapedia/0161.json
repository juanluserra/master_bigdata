    "descripcion": "Sentret is a small mammalian Pok√©mon covered in brown fur. It has long, dark brown ears with dark pink interiors, beady black eyes, and a small mouth. While it is capable of standing on its hind legs, it typically moves on all fours. It has a round body with wide arms and two small feet. On its belly is a white ring and there are dark brown stripes around its tail. Sentret has a cautious, timid nature and can often be seen standing on its tail to scout its surroundings. It will only sleep if there is another Sentret keeping watch and will be too frightened to sleep if separated from its pack. When it senses danger, it warns others by screeching and thumping its tail on the ground. Sentret can most commonly be found in temperate grasslands."
