    "descripcion": "Aurorus is a quadrupedal, dinosaurian Pokémon that resembles a sauropod. It is primarily blue with a light blue underside. It has bright blue eyes, a long neck, and a long, tapering tail with a teardrop-shaped tip. On its head is a V-shaped white marking with a single, light blue crystal in the center. Two large, flowing sails extend from the top of its head and run down the length of its neck. The sails are pale whitish-yellow at the base and fade into a pale bluish-purple at the edges. However, its sails can change color depending on its mood as seen in Pokémon-Amie. Running the length of its body on either side is a line of small ice crystals. There are three clawed toes on its hind legs, but one large nail and a single claw on its forelegs. Aurorus is usually quiet and kind but can create ice walls or encase enemies in ice when enraged. The crystals on its body produce freezing air as cold as −240 degrees Fahrenheit (−150 degrees Celsius). One Aurorus was discovered frozen in a glacier as it looked a long time ago. It is said that when Aurorus howls, several auroras will then appear in the sky. From Generation VIII onward, Aurorus and its pre-evolved form, Amaura, are the only known Pokémon that can have Refrigerate as an Ability."
