    "descripcion": "Lickilicky is a dark pink, rotund Pok√©mon with a small tail and a long tongue. It has a yellow line pattern on its belly and a white bib-like pattern. It also has what appears to be a curled appendage on its head. It has a big appetite. It can lick anything or anyone close by for any leftover crumbs. Its saliva contains a numbing solvent and can decompose anything, and it wraps its long tongue around things, like its prey, to coat them with its sticky saliva. It has space in its throat to store saliva, and it can also roll up its tongue and store it there. Lickilicky lives in forests with a large body of water. It uses its tongue with more skill than it would its hands and feet, and a current record of its stretch length exceeds 82 feet. Its tongue can also function with the same dexterity as a human hand. However, Lickilicky is rather clumsy with its own fingers."
