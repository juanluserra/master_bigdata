    "pokemon": "Tynamo",
    "pokedex_number": "0602",
    "origin": "Tynamo and its evolved forms are based on eels,[1] perhaps specifically the electric eel (which is actually a type of knifefish, despite its name). Tynamo in particular was designed to resemble the larval stage of the eel (leptocephalus)[1].",
    "description": "Tynamo is a short, white, eel-like Pokémon with dark, oval eyes and a red, four-point star-shaped mouth. A wavy, yellow stripe runs along its body, which has a long fin membrane, giving it a tapered shape. Tynamo has an organ that generates electricity, which it discharges when in danger. A single Tynamo does not generate much power, so groups of Tynamo move in schools and create a shock that is comparable to lightning. The Pokémon Company merchandise artwork and several TCG illustrations depict Tynamo swimming in or leaping out of bodies of water."
