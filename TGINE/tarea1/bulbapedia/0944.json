    "pokemon": "Shroodle",
    "pokedex_number": "0944",
    "origin": "Shroodle may be based on the Iberian shrew or the Pyrenean desman, two species of shrew found in the Iberian peninsula. Its venomous bite may be inspired by the fact that certain shrew species are among the few venomous mammals, and have a venomous bite that is used to paralyze earthworms and other prey.",
    "description": "Shroodle is a tiny shrew-like Pok√©mon with an almost hemispherical body, having a stubby tail and four small white feet with gray paw pads. Its fur is gray on top and white on the underside, except for its black head, which takes up about half of its body. Shroodle's head contains large, yellow-green eyes with tiny black pupils; small semicircular ears on the sides; a single tuft of blonde hair on top; and a long, bulbous snout at the front. The snout contains a pair of sharp upper incisors, coated in a purple poison that can cause paralysis. Shroodle has a mellow personality, but if angered, it will bite into the offender, inflicting them with its venom. It paints markings around its territory using a poisonous liquid with a sharp, unpleasant smell, in order to ward off intruders."
