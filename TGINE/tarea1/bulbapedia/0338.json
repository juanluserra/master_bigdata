    "pokemon": "Solrock",
    "pokedex_number": "0338",
    "origin": "Solrock seems to be based on the Sun, as well as a meteorite. Its squinted eyes may allude to the difficulty of looking directly at the Sun. Solrock's shiny coloration might be a reference to red dwarf stars.",
    "description": "Solrock is a primarily orange, spherical Pok√©mon. It has eight yellow, rocky spines extending from the sides of its body; and multiple small, yellow stony bumps running vertically along its center. On its back are dual rocky mounds, situated to the sides of the mid-line. Its large eyes consist of thick, semicircular yellow eyelids through which black sclerae and red pupils can be seen. A black ring with six extensions surrounds each eye. Solrock relies on solar energy, which it absorbs in groups during daylight. While it is always expressionless, it is able to sense the emotions and thoughts of others. It spins its body to produce intense heat and a blinding light. It is able to stay silent while floating in the air and can be found in caves. It is believed Solrock originated from space, specifically the sun."
