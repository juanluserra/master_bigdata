    "descripcion": "Lombre is a bipedal plant Pokémon that is mostly green with some light blue markings. Its face, ears, arms, and back are light blue. It has stubby, round ears, large eyes with small pupils, and a red bill-like mouth. There is a large lilypad on its head, which has a notch in it and resembles a sombrero. Lombre has long arms with four red claws and a thumb on each hand and feet with three red claws and a toe. Its entire body is covered in a thin, slimy film that creates an unpleasant sensation when touched. Lombre is sometimes mistaken for a human child. In Kitakami, there is a legend that Lombre was once a mischievous child before being reborn as a Pokémon. Lombre is a nocturnal Pokémon that sleeps on a bed of water grass during the day. Very mischievous, this Pokémon will tug on fishing lines from underwater and pop out to startle people. It feeds on aquatic moss that grows on rocks in the riverbed. Lombre prefers living in waterfronts that contain plenty of food. It tends to become nocturnal to avoid competition with bird Pokémon. Prior to Generation V, Lombre and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon that could have Rain Dish as an Ability."
