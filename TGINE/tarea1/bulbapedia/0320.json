    "descripcion": "Wailmer is a spherical whale Pokémon with no tail. It has a dark blue topside and a tan underbelly with grooves. It has two fins that have finger-like appendages, baleen plates that resemble teeth, and a pair of nostrils on the top of its head functioning as blowholes. Wailmer stores water inside its body, which it expels through its nostrils to startle people. When storing water in its body, it can turn into a bouncing ball. The more water filling its body, the higher it can bounce. It becomes lethargic when it is dry. It swims with its mouth open and eats tons of food a day, such as Wishiwashi. It lives in the sea, and can only live on land for a short amount of time. It occasionally bounces onto the beaches to play. On rare occasions, pods can be seen washed up on shore — a result of genetic memories of having once lived on land. Dhelmise and Sharpedo are natural predators to Wailmer, and Cetoddle is thought to be its close relative."
