    "pokedex_number": "0030",
    "origin": "Nidorina  appears to draw inspiration from rabbits, porcupines and rhinos, with aspects of venomous mammals. It may also reference the mythical Moon rabbit due to its rabbit like appearance and the fact that it reaches its final evolved form using a Moon Stone.",
    "description": "Nidorina is a quadrupedal, sky-blue mammalian Pokémon with dark-blue patches. It has red eyes, large, spiny ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It possesses large poison spikes, which it retracts whenever it is with a group, feeding its children,  or resting in its burrow. Its paws have three claws each, and it is able to stand on its hind legs. The hind legs are longer and thicker than its forelegs. It has a stubby tail. Nidorina is a female-only species. Nidorina is a gentle Pokémon, and it is known to be a caring mother that chews food for its young. It seems to display close family bonds with others of its kind and becomes nervous when separated. Nidorina prefers not to fight since its horn grows slowly, but if forced or enraged, it prefers physical attacks such as clawing and biting. Nidorina prefers to chew its food into a paste before spitting it out and feeding its children. It also emits ultrasonic cries to befuddle foes. Nidorina live in burrows at hot savannas and plains."
