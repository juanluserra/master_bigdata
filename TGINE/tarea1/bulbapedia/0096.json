    "pokemon": "Drowzee",
    "pokedex_number": "0096",
    "origin": "Drowzee may be based on the Japanese myth of the baku, creatures who eat bad dreams of sleeping people. Originally, they were composite animals, but later became tapirs — pig-like animals with small trunks from South America and South Asia. Drowzee's dual coloring makes it especially similar to the Malayan tapir.",
    "description": "Drowzee is a bipedal Pokémon that resembles a tapir. It has tired-looking eyes, a short trunk above its mouth, and triangular ears with brown interiors. The upper half of Drowzee's body is yellow and the lower half is brown. A wavy line separates the two halves. It has a round belly and short legs. Its feet are brown, except for its two toes, which are yellow. The bottom of each foot has a small, round, pink pad in the middle of it. There are three fingers on each of its hands. Drowzee is believed to have a common ancestor with Munna and Musharna. Drowzee is able to put people to sleep and can then sense the person's dreams. This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating. It has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams. It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier. Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten and may show past meals to a person it trusts. It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep. Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas."
