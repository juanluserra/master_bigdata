    "origin": "Croconaw appears to be based on a crocodilian. In Pokémon Sleep, Croconaw and its evolutionary relatives are revealed to sleep with one eye open, just like real-life crocodiles.",
    "description": "Croconaw is a bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon. It has well-developed, rounded jaws with two fangs visible in the corners of the lower jaw even when closed. Its eyes are red with black markings around them. There are three clusters of red spikes on its body: one with three points on top of its head, one with two points between its shoulders, and a diamond-shaped one near the tip of its tail. While most of its body is blue, its lower jaw is yellow and there is an asymmetrical, yellow-and-blue pattern around its chest that resembles a spotted animal skin. Although Croconaw is described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible. The tips of its teeth are slanted backward similar to a barbed fish hook; this makes them impossible to remove once embedded in something. Once Croconaw has bitten down onto something, it will not let go until it loses its teeth; any missing teeth will quickly grow back. Croconaw can rarely be found near water. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Croconaw and its evolutionary relatives are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep. During sleep, as one half of Croconaw's brain rests, the eye on the same side opens. This allows Croconaw to watch for enemy attacks while it sleeps."
