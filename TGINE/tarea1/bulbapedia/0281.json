    "pokemon": "Kirlia",
    "pokedex_number": "0281",
    "origin": "Kirlia seems to be based a young, feminine ballet dancer and the concept of empathy. The white frills surrounding its body resemble a tutu, and its thin, pointed legs make it appear as if it is standing en pointe and wearing green tights. Its hair is styled into pigtails, with its horns positioned like barettes or scrunchies. The red horns also resemble two halves of a heart, which may relate to its ability to sense emotions.",
    "description": "Kirlia is a bipedal, maiden-like humanoid Pokémon that appears to be wearing a tutu. Most of its body is colored white, and there are three ruffles on each hip. Beneath the ruffles, it has skinny green legs with long, pointed feet. Its arms are also thin with two digits each. It has green hair that covers most of its face and reaches its shoulders on either side, resembling two ponytails. Large, red eyes are visible on either side of the hair that covers its face. On each side of its head is a flat, crimson horn that resembles a hairpin. Kirlia's horns are used to amplify its psychokinetic power and distort the air around it. The distortion in the air causes scenery mirages and can cause a rip in dimensions. This ability also allows Kirlia to see into the future. It enjoys dancing on sunny mornings, and grows beautiful when exposed to a Trainer with positive emotions. Kirlia inhabits urban areas. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Kirlia is known to dance while it sleeps.[1] The reason is due to Kirlia having a premonition of a fun future in its dreams."
