    "descripcion": "Blipbug is an insectoid Pok√©mon. It has five body segments and is covered in sensitive setae that it uses to collect information about its environment. The dorsal half of its ovular head is a dark blue, and the ventral half is beige. Blipbug's large, reflective eyes resemble glasses. It has a small mouth and eyebrow-like markings that give it a perpetually surprised expression. Blipbug's second body segment is the same shade of blue as the top of its head, and resembles a collar. The third segment is thinner than the first two, and the two consecutive segments are thicker. Its last three segments are white, yellow, and blue respectively. Blipbug has two legs on both its third and fourth body segment; and it also has tufts of setae on its head, collar, and posterior. The setae on its collar are yellow and resemble a bow tie. A constant collector of information, Blipbug are very smart, but very weak. They are often found in gardens."
