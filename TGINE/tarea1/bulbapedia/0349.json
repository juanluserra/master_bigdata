    "descripcion": "Feebas is a shabby, old-looking, fishlike Pokémon with a light brown body covered in dark, irregular spots. It has large, deep-set eyes and big, pink lips. The tail and pectoral fins are dull blue and tattered in appearance. The dorsal fin is triangular with a hole in the middle. Feebas is famous for its shabby appearance and is considered the shabbiest Pokémon. Due to its poor appearance, it is largely ignored by predators, Trainers, and researchers alike. However, this hardy Pokémon is capable of eating anything and living anywhere. It is often found in oceans and weed-choked ponds, even if only a little water is available. While there are many of these Pokémon in existence, populations tend to cluster in small areas. Once found, its dull wits make it easy to capture. Feebas is a source of research due to its vitality despite it being unattractive and unpopular. There are even those who love to collect Feebas and only it, and reportedly are disappointed by its evolution into Milotic. In the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode The Cuteness Quotient!, Prism Scales are revealed to form naturally on Feebas on occasion."
