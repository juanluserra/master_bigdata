    "descripcion": "Tinkatink is a short, pink, humanoid Pokémon, with a relatively large head and arms compared to the rest of its body and stumpy toeless feet. Its arms have three fingers each, and it has what appears to be a pyramidal diamond-shaped steel plate on its torso. Its head has light pink circles on its cheeks, silver eyes, and a mouth with a square teeth-like growth on the lower lip. It has thin eyebrows or eyelashes above its eyes that give it a perpetually worried expression. On top of its head is a light pink cap with a white protrusion on top, resembling tied hair. Tinkatink carries a crude, gray, cylindrical hammer with a short handle, which resembles a baby's rattle. It creates its own hammer using iron scraps, remaking it as many times as it wants until it is satisfied. Tinkatink uses the hammer to protect itself. However, the hammer is often stolen and eaten by Pokémon with a metal diet. Tinkatink is a female-only species. Tinkatink resides in various ruins across Paldea."
