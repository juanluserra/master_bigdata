    "descripcion": "Pignite is a bipedal, pig-like Pokémon. Its chubby body is orange with brown bands around its shoulders, sides, belly, hands, and from the back of its head down its snout. Yellow bands encircle its wrists and swirled yellow designs bulge from its chest. It has a red pig-like nose, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth that protrude from its lower jaw. Its hands have two claws each, while its feet have only a single nail. Its tail is curled with a tuft of fur at the tip. Pignite is willing to defend its friends from opponents, no matter how strong they are. It has a fire in its stomach, which it fuels with food. This fire can affect its body temperature. The intensity of this flame increases as fuel is added or when Pignite is angered. As the flame grows stronger, Pignite's speed increases. On occasion, Pignite's body temperature will go so high that it becomes engulfed by a scorching fireball. However, it has no strength remaining whenever it has an empty stomach. If in danger, it will blow out large smoke clouds to escape. Prior to Generation VIII, Pignite and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Heat Crash."
