    "pokemon": "Chi-Yu",
    "pokedex_number": "1004",
    "origin": "Chi-Yu may be modeled after members of the Cyprinidae family, specifically the goldfish. The beads around its eyes make it particularly similar to the telescope eye and celestial eye breeds. The curved beads by its eyes are based on the magatama, comma-shaped beads made of jade that served as ceremonial and religious objects. The coloration and location of the beads, together with Chi-Yu being born from envy, may invoke the idea of the \"green-eyed monster\", a phrase coined in William Shakespeare's Othello to refer to jealousy.",
    "description": "Chi-Yu is a fish-like Pokémon. It is composed of two pairs of curved jade beads, once believed to be sacred and commonly worn for religious rituals. Each of these pairs of beads circle a black orb coated by white around the sides; together, they make up the eyes of Chi-Yu, while the rest of its fish-shaped body is formed by a dark red and yellow flame. The beads sometimes glow red and yellow when it attacks. Like the other treasures of ruin, Chi-Yu's true form is the beads forming its eyes, having been given life by the envy of those who desired them enough to start wars over them — while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over fire. Chi-Yu's flames burn at over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit (3,000 degrees Celsius), allowing it to melt rock and sand into lava that it can swim through. It is known as the Beads of Ruin. Chi-Yu and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ruination. Chi-Yu is also the only known Pokémon that can have Beads of Ruin as an Ability."
