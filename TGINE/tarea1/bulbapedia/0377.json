    "descripcion": "Regirock is a large golem-like Pokémon made of brown and orange rocks. It has a pattern of seven orange dots on its face that resembles a capital letter \"H\". It has long arms with jutting shoulders and club-like hands without fingers. There is a line of orange rocky spines running down its back, and its legs are short in comparison to its body. According to legend, Regirock was created by the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas using rocks. It used to be worshipped by humans, however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away. In Hoenn, it was sealed in the Desert Ruins; in Sinnoh, it was sealed in the Rock Peak Ruins; and in Galar, it was sealed in the Rock Peak Ruins. When it gets damaged in battle, it will search for new rocks to repair itself. Because of this, the rocks it is made of come from several different places around the world, which contributes to Regirock's patchwork appearance. Recently, cutting-edge technology has found that Regirock is entirely made of stone and rock, not even a heart or a brain was found."
