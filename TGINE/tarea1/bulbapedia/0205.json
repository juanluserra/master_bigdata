    "pokedex_number": "0205",
    "origin": "Forretress may be based on a bagworm, possibly one inhabiting a discarded shell of a horse chestnut or a walnut, though it resultingly resembles bivalves such as giant clams, as they share a two-half shell structure. Before Pokémon Scarlet and Violet depicted it levitating, Forretress's primary means of locomotion was hopping, which is similar to the Mexican jumping bean, a nut pod which appears to jump because it contains a writhing bug larva. Following Pineco's weaponry theme, Forretress seems be based on gun turrets, bombs, cannons and cannonballs, and fortresses. The tube-shaped cannons around it resemble the siphons in insects and molluscs.",
    "description": "Forretress is a large, spherical insectoid Pokémon with no visible limbs. The upper and lower halves of its body are capped by bumpy steel plates, giving it a strong defense against opponents. The outer plates have zigzagging ridges that open along its back and front, revealing its smooth, red inner shell. The inner shell is punctuated by four cylindrical spikes, each tapering to an open point. Between the spikes, the inner shell opens along a straight line to reveal Forretress's eyes, which are round with large pupils. Whatever else lies inside its shell is unknown. Forretress can defend itself from enemies by shooting out pieces of its outer shell, as a conditioned reflex rather than a conscious effort. It opens its shell to capture prey, but this happens so quickly that its interior body cannot be seen. It lives in tropical and temperate forests, attaching itself immovably to tree trunks. As shown in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Forretress is capable of levitation."
