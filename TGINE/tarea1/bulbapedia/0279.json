    "descripcion": "Pelipper is a pelican-like Pokémon whose head and bill make up the majority of its body. It has white feathers with a short, blue crest on top of its head. There are three blue digits on each of its wide wings, and it has blue feet with three webbed digits. Each eye is made of two black semicircles with a horizontal white line between them. Its large yellow bill appears to extend along its underside. Inside Pelipper's bill is a throat pouch that it uses to carry Eggs and small Pokémon such as its own young and Pyukumuku, and is large enough to fit a small child in. Due to this, Pelipper is often compared to a courier or a messenger. Skimming across the top of waves, it scoops food from the sea and swallows it in one gulp. It can swallow up to 30 Wishiwashi in one go, and loves to eat abandoned Luvdisc that are too despondent to be wary near the sea surface. It builds its nest on steep cliffs facing the sea. Young male Pelipper are in charge of gathering food and bringing it back to others at its nest. Pelipper rests its wings while floating in the ocean."
