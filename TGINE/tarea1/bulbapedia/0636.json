    "pokemon": "Larvesta",
    "pokedex_number": "0636",
    "origin": "Larvesta is based on a moth larva[1] — likely the larvae of the Atlas moth or the Sycamore Tussock moth. Its appearance, especially the red growths around its body, also references the Tower of the Sun, a famed Japanese monument.[1] The red growths may also reference sun rays or the Daimonji, while its overall body shape may also be based on a torch or cigar.",
    "description": "Larvesta is a fuzzy, moth larva-like Pokémon. It has blue eyes in a shadowed face. Its white mane of fuzz encompasses its head and the upper half of its body, while its lower half is brown. It has three pairs of small black legs. There are five red, slightly whorled horns on the sides of its head. Larvesta can shoot fire from its five horns as a defensive tactic to intimidate predators or to scare prey. It has been seen using the fire that it shoots from these horns to fly. Larvesta's flames can reach up to almost 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature. The horns' flames can cut through even sheets of iron. It lives at the feet of volcanoes, though people of ancient times once believed that Larvesta nested on and fell from the sun; some people still say that it was born from the sun. In ancient times, it was known as the  Larva That Stole the Sun and emissary of the sun. Despite this, Larvesta is considered a burden due to it causing constant forest fires. When it evolves into Volcarona, its body becomes enveloped in flames, akin to a cocoon."
