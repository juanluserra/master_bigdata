    "descripcion": "Cacnea is a green, bipedal Pok√©mon with a round body and cactus-like striations. It has a dark green rhombus shape above its face, and six dark green rhombus shapes that ring around its waist. It has dark circles around its eyes, and its mouth composed of several similar circles. It has two dark green spikes on each side of its head, along with a yellow flower bud on top of its head. It has two club-like arms that are ringed with dark green spikes, and its two stubby legs are dark green and conical. Cacnea uses its thorny arms like hammers to attack its opponents. Prior to Generation V, Needle Arm was its signature move. It is able to live in deserts for 30 days without any water, due to its body being able to store moisture. The beauty and fragrance of its yellow flower depend on the harshness of its environment. This flower releases a strong aroma to attract prey. When prey approaches, Cacnea shoots sharp thorns to bring it down."
