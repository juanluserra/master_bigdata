    "descripcion": "Accelgor is a Pokémon which has a large pink head reminiscent of a helmet that is curled in the back. Green stripes run from its eyes to the top of its head, and there is a black star-like marking or hole on the front. Its eyes are hidden in a shadowed crevice in its head. The rest of its body is covered by a blue, cloth-like membrane, which keeps Accelgor from dehydrating, with ribbon-like extensions at the top of its back. Its arms, when crossed, portray an aggressive mood. It is a very fast Pokémon and attacks in ways similar to ninjas. In Generation VIII, Water Shuriken was its signature move. It lives in moist habitats like bogs and swamps. Accelgor is often featured as a main character in movies or comics to increase the popularity of these products. Accelgor's pouting expression and crossed arms are due to it being miserable over having lost its shell.[1]"
