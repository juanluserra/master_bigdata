    "descripcion": "Cryogonal is a Pokémon made of ice crystals, which resembles a shiny, blue hexagonal snowflake. Its facial expression is frozen, which leaves Cryogonal with a still, aggressive-looking face. Two cracks run through its face: the upper opening contains its eyes, and the lower serves as a mouth. It has two glowing eyes and its large mouth contains an extendable chain of ice, which is used for hunting. Cryogonal is born in snow clouds, although there are rumors stating that it is born from people and Pokémon that have died on snowy mountains. When its body heat rises, it will turn into steam and vanish, but it will revert to ice when the body temperature lowers. As a result, Cryogonal is rarely seen during the summer, and are commonly seen during winter seasons. Cryogonal uses its ice chain to capture its prey and freeze them at a temperature of -148 °F (-100 °C), before taking them to unknown locations."
