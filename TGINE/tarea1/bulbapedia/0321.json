    "descripcion": "Wailord is a huge cetacean Pokémon resembling the blue whale. It has small beady eyes, a huge mouth, and a tan throat and underbelly that are lined with grooves. Its back is blue with four white spots running down its spine, and two breathing nostrils on top of its head. It has two pairs of blue fins along its sides, a smaller third pair of tan fins on its rear, and a horizontal tail at the back. Wailord is one of the largest Pokémon to have been discovered. Due to its immense size, it can make giant splashes by jumping out of the water and then crashing back down. These shockwaves allow Wailord to knock out its opponents and herd its prey. Wailord is able to eat large quantities at one time, such as schools of Wishiwashi. However, it will flee from Wishiwashi when the latter is in its School Form. Wailord has an easygoing temperament and loves to play. Its size causes it to have almost no natural enemies; its only known predator is Dhelmise. Wailord lives in the sea in large groups called pods. These pods, which often include Wailmer, travel together in order to search for food. When a Wailmer is attacked by its predators Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works to defend it. Wailord can dive deep at 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in one breath. Wailord is popular due to its size. As a result, Wailord-watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world. However, Wailord are known to be driven away by fishermen when they become too numerous, so they don't eat too much fish Pokémon."
