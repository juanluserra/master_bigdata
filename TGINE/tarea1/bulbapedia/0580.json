    "pokemon": "Ducklett",
    "pokedex_number": "0580",
    "origin": "Ducklett seems to be based on a duckling or cygnet. Its bottom plumage also resembles a swim ring, while its evolved form has similar plumage that resembles a bikini. Its evolutionary line may also be based on the fairy-tale The Ugly Duckling, in which the \"ugly duckling\" someday becomes a beautiful swan.",
    "description": "Ducklett is light-blue, duckling-like Pok√©mon. It has two feathery tufts on its head that connect at the bottom, forming a V-shape. It has a darker blue, feathery underside which makes it appear as if it were in mid-moult. It has yellow, webbed feet and a small tail. Ducklett lives around ponds and rivers. Ducklett is not very good at flying yet and tends to watch its Swanna parents on how to fly. It is better at swimming than flying. It is a talented diver and can spray water from its feathers for self-defense. The foe is distracted by the spray, allowing Ducklett to escape. Ducklett can increase its strength by diving into the depths of ponds. This helps it search for its favorite food. Ducklett's diet consists of both peat and bog moss."
