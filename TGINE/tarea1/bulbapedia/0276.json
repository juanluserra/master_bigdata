    "descripcion": "Taillow is a small avian Pokémon with dark blue feathers. A red marking with pointed tips stretches from its chest to its forehead, and it has a white underside. It has narrow brown eyes and a short yellow beak. It has elongated wingtips and black feet with yellow talons. Each foot has three toes facing forward and one backward. Two sharply pointed feathers form its tail. Taillow is very gutsy and will stand up to powerful opponents without backing down. During the cold season, this Pokémon will fly over 180 miles (300 kilometers) per day to search for areas that have warm climates. It typically hunts Wurmple, but flocks have also been shown eating crops in the Pokémon Chronicles episode We're No Angels!. When it is hungry, it will weaken and cry loudly."
