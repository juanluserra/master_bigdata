    "descripcion": "Chien-Pao is a feline Pokémon with an elongated body composed of snow. Ice crystals run down its back and legs, and also forms its claws, eyes, and whiskers. Its large fangs, tipped with ice, comprise two pieces of a broken, ornately patterned sword. The sword's blade, which narrows slightly near the tip, forms its left fang; while the sword's hilt forms its right fang. The broken ends of the sword halves jut through Chien-Pao's upper jaw. Like the other treasures of ruin, Chien-Pao's true form is that of the broken sword forming its fangs, having been given life by the hatred of people slain by those who wielded it long ago — while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over ice and snow. Chien-Pao is described as being able to control 100 tons of fallen snow, causing avalanches and playing around in them innocently. It is known as the Sword of Ruin. Chien-Pao and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ruination. Chien-Pao is also the only known Pokémon that can have Sword of Ruin as an Ability."
