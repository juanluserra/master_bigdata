    "pokemon": "Roaring Moon",
    "pokedex_number": "1005",
    "origin": "Roaring Moon is based on Salamence, specifically its Mega Evolved form. By extension, it also appears to be based on European dragons. Its feathers are similar to those of feathered dinosaurs. The shape of its wings resembles a crescent moon, commonly used as an icon in Islamic societies such as Al-Andalus (the Iberean Peninsula, Paldea's real-world inspiration, when it was under Muslim rule between the eighth and fifteenth centuries). The ridged white part on top of its head is vaguely reminiscent of Bagon's protective growth.",
    "description": "Roaring Moon is a quadrupedal, draconic Pokémon with a long, tapering tail. It is primarily blue with a red underside with four yellow markings. There are red markings on the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its hind legs. Additionally, there are raised white ridges above its eyes. Jagged, light blue spikes protrude from either side of its head. Its mouth features sharp teeth, with a pair of three teeth on the upper jaw and a pair of single teeth in the lower. Each of its legs has three, long claws, with its front legs being longer and bulkier, and sporting three protruding scales close to the knees. On its back rests very large red wings that begin with a three-pronged yellow pattern on both sides, that then curl upward into a crescent moon-like shape which gives the Pokémon its name, with blue-tipped feather-like protrusions on the ends. Below its wings is a jagged cape-like structure with a black underside. According to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Roaring Moon is named after a similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. The article says it looks similar to Salamence that has undergone a certain phenomenon that occurs elsewhere in the world, but it’s unclear if there is any connection. It's said that Roaring Moon scatters feathers as it flies around at high speeds seeking prey. It's thought to be more savage than Salamence and that it should be avoided at all costs. According to AI Sada, Roaring Moon is an ancient Pokémon related to Salamence. However, according to a Sada at the Crystal Pool, Roaring Moon is a counterpart of Salamence from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Roaring Moon were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago."
