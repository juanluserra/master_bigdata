    "descripcion": "Zarude is a simian Pokémon resembling a baboon or mandrill. Its body is primarily covered in coarse black fur, though its chest and belly are patterned with shorter gray fur. Its upper snout, palms, and rings around its eyes are devoid of fur, and its skin is a light gray. The fur around the side of its head angles into wing-like crests on either side of its eyes. The eyes themselves have red sclerae, green irises, and black, slitted pupils. Its teeth are pointed and its canines are visible when its mouth is closed. Zarude can extend prehensile vines from its wrists, neck, and the soles of its feet at will. It uses these strong and flexible vines to attack, swing from trees, and collect food from a distance. Zarude's vines can also rapidly heal wounds when wrapped around them, and absorb energy from trees.[1] While resting, only the tips of the vines at Zarude's neck and feet extend beyond its skin. However, the vines extending from Zarude's wrists are typically wrapped around its forearms in four concentric rings. Occasionally, Zarude's vines tear off and become nutrients for the soil of the forests it lives in. As shown in Secrets of the Jungle, the number of vines can vary, and may indicate a Zarude's age or importance, with Zarude possessing the most vines being the oldest or most dominant. Zarude are social and live in troops. They're usually incredibly aggressive, and frighten most other Pokémon. They attack anyone that aren't part of their pack; they excel in battle with their sharp claws and quick wit.[1] Zarude is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Jungle Healing."
