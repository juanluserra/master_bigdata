    "pokemon": "Amaura",
    "pokedex_number": "0698",
    "origin": "Amaura is based on a young sauropod dinosaur, specifically the Amargasaurus, which were speculated to have sail-like fins or skin extensions on their vertebral spines. According to designer Hitoshi Ariga, he decided to design Pokémon based on sauropods with the consideration that they would pair well with the Tyrannosaurus-based Tyrantrum's evolutionary line. The Amargasaurus was chosen as a base for these sauropod Pokémon to differentiate them from other Pokémon with similar body shapes such as Lapras, Meganium, or Deino.[2] Amaura also shares traits with various other species of Diplodocoidea (a classification of sauropods which includes Amargasaurus).",
    "description": "Amaura is a quadrupedal, dinosaurian Pokémon that resembles a sauropod. It is light blue with a white underbelly. It has a long neck, a short, stubby tail, and a single white claw on each hind foot. Above each of its large, deep blue eyes is an iridescent, sail-like structure. Typically, the sails are yellow at the bottom and fade into pink toward the tips. On each side of its body is a dark blue crystal. Pokémon-Amie has demonstrated that its sails can change color with its mood and the crystals on its sides permanently remain at freezing temperatures. This ancient Pokémon was restored from a Sail Fossil that had been frozen in ice for over 100,000,000 years. However, although Amaura was restored successfully, it is not expected to live long in the heat of the current environment. It calmly lived in cold lands where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum around. As seen in the anime, when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky. From Generation VIII onward, Amaura and its evolved form, Aurorus, are the only known Pokémon that can have Refrigerate as an Ability."
