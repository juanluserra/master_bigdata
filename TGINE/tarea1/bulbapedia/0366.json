    "pokemon": "Clamperl",
    "pokedex_number": "0366",
    "origin": "Clamperl appears to be based on an oyster or a giant clam. Clamperl's appearance and its evolved forms suggest that it could also be based on roe, the eggs of fish and other marine animals.",
    "description": "Clamperl is an aquatic bivalve Pokémon that makes its home on the seafloor. Its bivalve shell is dark blue with a silver rim along the inner edges. The shell is used to clamp down on prey, as well as for protection. A fully-grown shell will have nicks and scratches all over. Inside of the shell is a fragile, light blue body composed of six spherical extensions with a pink, pearl-like head in the center, usually depicted with its eyes closed. There is a circular white patch on each cheek. The pearls produced by this Pokémon amplify psychic power and can be blue in color, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Clamperl of Wisdom. Spoink's pearls come from Clamperl. These pearls are also 10 times more valuable than pearls produced by Shellder. It is carnivorous, clamping down on prey without letting go until it stops moving. When it is close to evolution, Clamperl will become too big to fit inside its shell. Clamperl is the only Pokémon that gains extra effects by holding a Deep Sea Tooth or Deep Sea Scale. Clamperl have been observed being carried by Drifblim, its natural predator."
