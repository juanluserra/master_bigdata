    "descripcion": "Budew is a bipedal, rosebud-like Pokémon. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon. Its face is yellow with small, slit-like eyes. It appears to be wearing a green bib and has triangular, stubby yellow feet. When the two vines that are on top of its head open up, a big spot can be seen on each. One vine has a blue spot, while the other has a red spot. Budew keeps its buds closed during the cold winter, but opens them again in the spring and releases poisonous pollen. The pollen it scatters induces harsh sneezing and runny noses, and is more toxic depending on how clean the water it was fed with was. Budew's bud beginning to open is seen as the imminent arrival of spring. It lives near clean pools and ponds."
