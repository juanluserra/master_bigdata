    "pokemon": "Swanna",
    "pokedex_number": "0581",
    "origin": "Swanna is based on a mute swan, and its evolutionary line is based on the fairy-tale The Ugly Duckling. Additionally, its design seems to draw inspiration from the outfit worn by the main character of the Swan Lake ballet, Odette.",
    "description": "Swanna is a swan-like Pok√©mon with primarily white plumage. Its beak is long and yellow topped with a black cere, and it has several white feathery features adorning its head. The more rounded of the features are to the sides of its head, and the more pointed feature is atop. Swanna possesses a long, curving neck. With a fluid neck and a strong bill, Swanna is capable of very accurate jabbing and thrusting attacks. Two light-blue feathery features, similar to those on the sides of Swanna's head, are present on Swanna's underside, and Swanna's large wings are positioned so that they curve away from its body. Swanna's legs are small, and its webbed feet are dark. Swanna is known to fly for thousands of miles without rest, and it flies out when the sun rises. At dusk, flocks of Swanna will dance, with the leader in the middle of the routine. Swanna is quite physically powerful for its graceful appearance as its beak can deliver forceful blows. Many artists have claimed to have taken inspiration from a Swanna performing a beautiful dance during the light of dawn."
