    "pokemon": "Pineco",
    "pokedex_number": "0204",
    "origin": "Pineco may be based on a bagworm, whose cases—or \"bags\"—may superficially resemble pine cones. Its primary means of locomotion is hopping, which is similar to the Mexican jumping bean, a nut pod which appears to jump because it contains a writhing bug larva. Its appearance and ability to explode also give it the resemblance of a grenade. In addition to its possible relation to weaponry, its ability to learn Spikes may be a reference to caltrops—especially as this is the move's Japanese name.",
    "description": "Pineco is an insectoid Pokémon encased in a blue-green, pine cone-like shell that protects it from bird Pokémon. It has red eyes and no visible limbs, along with a single spike on top of its head, which is supposedly its stem. It makes its shell thicker by gluing tree bark to its body. The glue is made of fluid that Pineco spits out, which hardens when it is exposed to air. Pineco's shell becomes bigger and thicker as more tree bark is accumulated; older Pineco are very large in size. Unbothered by the added weight of its shell, Pineco patiently hangs from a tree branch in tropical and temperate forests, waiting to prey on flying insects. In Alola, its favorite prey is Cutiefly. Typically immobile, it will drop to the ground and explode if someone shakes its tree while it is eating."
