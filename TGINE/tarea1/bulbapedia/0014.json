    "pokemon": "Kakuna",
    "pokedex_number": "0014",
    "origin": "Kakuna appears to be based on the pupal stage of a bee or wasp. Its tendency to dangle from a thread (as seen in the animated series and some spin-off games) may also be based on certain parasitoid wasps whose larvae construct hanging cocoons.",
    "description": "Kakuna is a yellow, insect cocoon-like Pokémon. Kakuna has a dome-shaped head and black, triangular eyes with glowing white pupils. It has two scythe-like arms in the middle of its body. When it comes close to evolving, its body gives off heat that makes it warm to the touch. Kakuna remains virtually immobile and waits for evolution, often hanging from tree branches by long strands of silk. When attacked, however, it can extend its poison barbs. Kakuna nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. Occasionally, it will also nest at the mouth of tunnels and caves, as seen in Pokémon Snap."
