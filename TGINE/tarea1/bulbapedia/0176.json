    "descripcion": "Togetic is a dainty, bipedal Pokémon that is small in stature. It is white with a red and blue triangular ring pattern on its body. It also has a relatively long neck and long legs and a pair of wings on its back, giving it a vaguely angelic appearance. Togetic is capable of levitating itself without needing to flap its wings. Togetic can sense the kindness in other people and Pokémon's hearts. Whenever it spots a pure-hearted person, it tends to go to that person and shower them with happiness and glowing down called \"joy dust\". To share its happiness, it is said to fly around the world seeking these people. If it is not with kind people, however, it becomes dispirited and loses energy. Togetic is rare in the wild, but can sometimes be found living within the forests. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Togetic is known to occasionally sleep while floating and steadily flapping its wings.[1] It is believed that a mysterious power is keeping Togetic in the air."
