    "pokemon": "Totodile",
    "pokedex_number": "0158",
    "origin": "Totodile appears to be based on a baby crocodilian. The yellow marking on its chest may be a reference to the yellow stripes on young American alligators. In Pokémon Sleep, Totodile and its evolutions are revealed to sleep with one eye open, just like real-life crocodiles. The crest on Totodile's back is similar to the mohawk hairstyle which may allude to Totodile's boisterous personality.",
    "description": "Totodile is a bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon with well-developed jaws. It has red eyes with ridges above them, black markings around its eyes, and several sharp teeth. On its chest is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends to its arms; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Totodile has five fingers and three toes. Down its back is a row of three red spines with a small, red ridge on either side. The tip of its tail has a single red spine as well. Totodile tends to be both playful and rough by nature and has a habit of biting anything it sees, including its Trainer. Despite its size, Totodile's jaws are capable of crushing anything, so it sometimes causes serious injuries. Turning one's back on Totodile is considered to be a bad idea as it can bite without warning. Totodile are scarce in the wild, though it can be found around bodies of water like rivers, ponds, and lakes. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Totodile and its evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep. This practice is hypothesized to be a defense mechanism against enemy attacks."
