    "pokemon": "Hitmonchan",
    "pokedex_number": "0107",
    "origin": "Based on its Japanese name and boxer aspects, Hitmonchan may represent the boxer Hiroyuki Ebihara. The colors of Hitmonchan's gloves in its normal and Shiny colorations might be a reference to the red corner and blue corner in boxing. Its Gold, HeartGold, Generation V, and X Pokédex entries mention that it needs a short break after fighting for three minutes, which is a reference to the duration of rounds in boxing.",
    "description": "Hitmonchan is a tan, humanoid Pokémon that is exclusively male and has no female counterpart. There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area. As its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop. In Generation II, Mach Punch was its signature move, but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding. Prior to Generation V, Iron Fist was Hitmonchan's signature Ability."
