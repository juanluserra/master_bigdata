    "descripcion": "Lotad is a small, blue plant Pokémon with six stubby legs. It has large eyes and a wide, yellow mouth similar to a bill. A large leaf that resembles a lilypad covers its back. This large leaf allows Lotad to float across ponds, and it will sometimes ferry smaller Pokémon on its back in this manner. The head leaf is a natural dirt-repellent. The leaf can stay clean even after transporting Pokémon covered in mud. However, the leaf will wilt if Lotad becomes dehydrated. Its size and weight prevent Lotad from living on land, but, on rare occasions, it travels on land in search of clean water. Lotad is known to gather in lakes of good water quality. The lake's surfaces are occasionally covered in Lotad leaves. Prior to Generation V, Lotad and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Rain Dish as an Ability."
