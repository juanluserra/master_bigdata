    "descripcion": "Golisopod is a large, arthropod Pokémon with a hunched, humanoid posture. It has a pale purple body covered with silver armor plating. It has a relatively small head with bright purple antennae that converge with its mandibles to form a mask around its eyes. The eyes themselves are black and angular with light gray pupils. Behind its head and curving down its back are several armor plates, each with a long protrusion curving up from each side. There is a small, greenish triangle marking on the center of each plate. Most of its lower body is exposed, but there is additional armor resembling a loincloth around its waist and smooth pieces encasing its thighs and feet. Its feet each have a single black claw. Golisopod has three pairs of arms. The two foremost pairs are thinner, encased in a silver exoskeleton, and each is tipped with a single, black claw. The hindmost pair of arms is longer and has much larger forearms. These large forearms both have three overlapping, armored plates on the back and two black claws. The plate closest to its claws is plain, while the last two each have two greenish, triangular markings. Golisopod has a shell as tough as diamonds and retractable claws that can cleave seawater in two. While it is skillful in battle, it often meditates peacefully deep in seaside caves. It is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod. Golisopod will do anything to win a fight. When it sees an opening to take advantage of, Golisopod will use the small claws on its front legs to finish off its opponent. Grapploct is the natural predator or prey of Golisopod, depending on who wins the fight. In Generation VII, First Impression was its signature move, but Farfetch'd could still inherit it via breeding. Golisopod is the only known Pokémon that can have Emergency Exit as an Ability."
