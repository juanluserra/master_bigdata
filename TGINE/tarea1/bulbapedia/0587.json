    "pokemon": "Emolga",
    "pokedex_number": "0587",
    "origin": "Emolga is based on a flying squirrel, with its patagial membrane designed to resemble a cape.[1] The squirrel specifically could be the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel. It may also be based on gliding marsupials such as the sugar glider and the feathertail glider. Emolga might be based on Pokémon mascot Pikachu as there is at least one electric rodent introduced in every generation, and as such its cheeks that store electricity might be based on rodents' cheeks that store food.",
    "description": "Emolga is a white, rodent-like Pokémon resembling a flying squirrel. It has black eyes, a tiny nose, and yellow electric sacs on its cheeks. Its ears, positioned at the top of its head, are rounded in shape and black in coloration, with yellow and white sections in the inside. It sports a vaguely hood-like patterning of black around its head, with a spiky extension of the pattern above its face. It has yellow winglike membrane flaps connected to its three-fingered arms. Its feet are white and fairly small and its black tail is in a jagged shape. Emolga lives in treetops, sometimes in holes gouged by Pikipek, and uses its flaps to glide from tree to tree. It generates electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks, stores it in its membrane, and discharges it while gliding. Emolga does this in order to be able to scare off bird Pokémon, giving it the capability to gather lots of food. It then grills its food, being berries or bug Pokémon, with electric shocks before eating. Due to its tendency to stuff its cheeks with food, Emolga sometimes has difficulties flying. While Emolga is cute, it tends to cause trouble."
