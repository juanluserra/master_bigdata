    "pokemon": "Carbink",
    "pokedex_number": "0703",
    "origin": "Carbink could be based on the carbuncle, a mythical fairy-like creature that was rumored to be able to emit light and have gemstones growing out of its body. It physically resembles ores, rocks that contains minerals with important elements that are valued for a high price.",
    "description": "Carbink is a gray, rock-like Pokémon with a conical body. Its body has light blue crystals of various shapes and sizes embedded in it. A white, fluffy collar surrounds its small head. It uses this soft mane to polish the gems of other Carbink. It has bright blue eyes, a light blue crystal on top of its head, and flat diamond-shaped ears. In some media depictions, the fluffy collar, ears, and pattern of the blue crystals on the Carbink’s body can differ based on size and crystal pattern. Due to its small stature, it ties with Minior and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type Pokémon. Carbink is born from the high temperatures and pressures underground. Since then, it has slept underground for millions of years. It is also occasionally found during cave excavations. It is known to compare its hard body with those of Geodude and Roggenrola. It is known to be preyed upon by Sableye, and caught by Gabite. Carbink defends itself by shooting high-energy beams from the gem on its head and other parts of its body. Although Carbink are not specially rare, the jewels on its body draw the attention from people. Rarely, Carbink will undergo a strange mutation and transform into the Mythical Pokémon Diancie. It is said that a pack of Carbink lives with a Diancie queen in a jeweled kingdom deep underground. It is also said that there lies a mineral vein housing another, larger pack of Carbink with another Diancie queen. Carbink is also one of the few Pokémon found in the Area Zero Underdepths."
