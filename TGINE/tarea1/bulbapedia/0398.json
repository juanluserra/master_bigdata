    "descripcion": "Staraptor is a grayish-brown, avian Pokémon similar to a large bird of prey. It has small, red eyes and a thin, yellow beak with a black tip. There is a circular white patch on its forehead, which is smaller on the female. Larger white markings cover the front of its throat and chest, separated by a black ruff encircling the shoulders. A red-tipped black crest extends over its head, nearly reaching the tip of its beak. Staraptor is fussy about the shape of this comb, which it uses to appear larger and frighten enemies. It has large wings, five black-tipped tail feathers, and yellow feet with black talons. Its powerful wing and leg muscles allow it to fly effortlessly while carrying other Pokémon, small or large. Upon evolution, this Pokémon leaves its flock to live alone, as it has become strong enough to take care of itself. It can be highly aggressive, persistently attacking even larger foes in spite of illness or injury."
