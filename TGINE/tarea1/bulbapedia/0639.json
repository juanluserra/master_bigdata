    "descripcion": "Terrakion is a bovine, quadrupedal Pokémon. It has a black, rounded forehead adorned with two brown, axe-like horns that curve forward. Its face is beige with orange eyes and a short snout. On top of its head are several short spikes. Down its back are two brown ridges that join just past its shoulders. There are two orange protrusions on its shoulders. The bands around its legs are the same color as its face, and it has black hooves underneath these bands. Its striped underside is also beige. It has a short, stubby tail. According to legend, Terrakion, alongside the other Swords of Justice had challenged the humans in order to protect other Pokémon from losing their homes to the humans's expansion. During the battle, Terrakion shaped the earth and created a passage to escape. The three Swords distrust humans because of a war that resulted in a forest fire in Moor of Icirrus. It is said to possess phenomenal strength; it can destroy a castle wall with one blow. Should a small Pokémon be bullied by anyone or anything, Terrakion will crush them without mercy. As seen in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, like other Legendary Pokémon, Terrakion can be found in the Pokémon paradise Laqua. As seen in both Pokémon the Series and Pokémon Adventures, it can create an energy blade out of its head. Terrakion loves Terrakion Treats made by Snacksworth, who once sat and enjoyed some snacks with it in the past. Iron Boulder shares a resemblance to Terrakion and is believed to be a futuristic Terrakion that was modified by a villainous organization. In Generation V, Sacred Sword was its signature move."
