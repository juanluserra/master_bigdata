    "pokemon": "Wishiwashi",
    "pokedex_number": "0746",
    "origin": "Wishiwashi's Solo Form bears a resemblance to Pacific sardines. Its eyes' ability to light up may be derived from flashlight fish. Its bioluminescence, great abundance, and overall shape may also reference the lanternfish. Its School Form bears some resemblance to a submarine and the extinct Dunkleosteus.",
    "description": "Wishiwashi is a fishlike Pokémon. It has two different forms depending on the situation. In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type. An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans,  Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.[1][2] Wishiwashi is the only known Pokémon that can have Schooling as an Ability."
