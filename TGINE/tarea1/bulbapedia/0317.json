    "pokedex_number": "0317",
    "origin": "Swalot may be based on myriad organs or glands, such as a stomach, a gallbladder, or a single, giant poison gland. It may also be based upon a generic organism that uses pseudopodia. Its general shape resembles a slug.",
    "description": "Swalot is a tall, purple, amorphous Pok√©mon. It has red, beady eyes and yellow whiskers. A female Swalot has shorter whiskers than a male. It has puckered lips and can fit an automobile tire in its mouth. Its hands have three fingers. It has a single row of black rhombi running across its midsection, and it can expand and contract its body at will. Swalot is capable of swallowing anything whole and can digest anything except its own stomach lining. It covers prey and opponents with a powerful poison. It likes eating poisoned and poisonous things. It lives in grasslands and savannas. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Swalot sometimes sleeps with its mouth wide open.[1] It is believed that Swalot is dreaming of a huge meal it is attempting to swallow whole."
