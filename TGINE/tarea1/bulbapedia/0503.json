    "descripcion": "Samurott is a quadrupedal Pok√©mon resembling a river otter or sea lion. Its head, dorsal coat, and limbs are royal blue, and its underbelly is a dull bluish-gray. It has pointed canine teeth, and a red nose, and its eyes have white sclera and circular red irises. Long white whiskers resembling mustaches extend from its snout and lower jaw. Samurott possesses three black claws on each limb, and a fin-like tail resembling a war fan. Samurott's head, limbs, and tail are adorned with cream-colored armor resembling seashells. The armor on its head resembles a spiked conch shell. This helmet-like armor is bulbous in the back, and tapers into a spear-like horn in the front. Segmented armor resembling bracers covers each of Samurott's limbs. The forelimbs' bracers contain shell swords called seamitars. The two lower segments of these bracers serve as scabbards for these seamitars, and the upper segment and spike are the seamitars' blade and handle, respectively. In battle, Samurott can stand on its hind limbs and use its seamitars to fight. In the time it takes a foe to blink, Samurott can draw, attack with, and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs. It is said that Samurott can fell an opponent in one swing, and that it can silence foes with a glare or a howl. Samurott is a master of a sword-drawing art called iaijutsu. Samurott leads its group with strict leadership. Samurott will mercilessly thrash those who do not follow its rules with the group."
