    "descripcion": "Misdreavus is a dark bluish-green, ghost-like Pokémon. While it has no visible arms or legs, its lower half has several small appendages and resembles a ruffled dress. It has five round red gems halfway around its neck, which are used to absorb fear and use it as nourishment. When defeated in the side series games, its body disappears, leaving only the gems around its neck behind. This implies that Misdreavus retreats into the gems when it has been severely weakened. It has long, flowing lilac-tipped \"hair\". Misdreavus's large, red eyes have yellow sclerae. Misdreavus lives in caves. As a nocturnal Pokémon, it spends its days sleeping in darkness and its nights startling people with mischievous tricks. Since it loves watching frightened people, it is known to yank and bite at people's hair or sneak up on them and cry and shriek in a way a child would. In the animated series, Misdreavus is shown to be able to use its \"hair\" to grasp objects and other Pokémon, as if it were hands. Flutter Mane shares a resemblance to Misdreavus. It was theorized to be a giant Misdreavus reborn as a pterosaur ghost. Prior to Generation IV, Pain Split was its signature move. In Generation II, Psywave was also its signature move. Other Pokémon could still inherit both moves via breeding."
