    "descripcion": "Skorupi is a Pokémon which resembles an oversized, pale purple scorpion. Its claws and tail have been swapped, giving it two stingers and a claw tail. The miniature jaws, claws, and tail claws are white. Its arms are attached directly to its head, close to its teal eyes. A pointed marking joins its eyes. The head, arms, two tail segments, and all four legs are light blue, while the body, tail end, and other two tail segments are a darker shade of blue. It buries itself in sand and lies in wait for unsuspecting prey, gripping it with its tail claws and injecting poison; it will then hold on until the poison takes effect. However, it is capable of surviving for a year without nourishment. Skorupi is related to Sizzlipede through a common ancestor. Skorupi is found in deserts and dry areas like Reversal Mountain, though it can be found in marshy areas such as the Great Marsh. Skorupi is considered a highly dangerous Pokémon due its lethal claws and poison. However, Skorupi cannot stand cold temperatures, becoming weaker when exposed."
