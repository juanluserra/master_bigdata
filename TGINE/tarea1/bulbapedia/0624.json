    "descripcion": "Pawniard is a small, bipedal Pok√©mon with a vaguely beetle-like appearance. It has a rounded red and black head with a silvery blade extending from the front. Its face is gray with yellow eyes. Two pairs of steel blades protrude from either side of its black torso, connected by steel ribs. It has red arms that end with knife-like blades instead of hands. It also has red legs with two white toes located on both sides of each feet. When hunting, Pawniard immobilizes prey by repeated stabbing with its blades after clinging on to them. It then clangs its arm blades together afterwards. Any chips in Pawniard's blades would prove fatal for it; thus, Pawniard regularly sharpens its blades with its favorite sharpening stones found by rivers. Pawniard is noted to be an especially courageous fighter. In the wild, Pawniard lives in packs governed by Bisharp. The Pawniard will attack when commanded by Bisharp and will continue to do so even if they are injured. Each member of the pack trains diligently, hoping to one day take the lead. Tinkatuff is a natural enemy of Pawniard."
