    "pokedex_number": "0043",
    "origin": "Oddish seems to be based on mandrake, plants from the Mandragora genus whose roots sometimes resemble human figures. Its habit of screaming when yanked out of the ground may be a reference to the myth that mandrakes will emit a deadly cry when uprooted. Its round body is also similar to various bulbous plant such as onions as well as root vegetables such as radishes and turnips. Its leaves are similar in shape to those of the snake plant.",
    "description": "Oddish is a Pokémon that resembles a blue plant bulb or a root vegetable. It has a round body, beady red eyes, a small mouth, and ovoid feet. Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Foul Weather Friends, these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects. Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus, Oddish lives in grasslands. A nocturnal Pokémon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. Oddish will wander up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move."
