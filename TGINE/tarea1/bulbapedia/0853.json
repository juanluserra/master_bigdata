    "pokemon": "Grapploct",
    "pokedex_number": "0853",
    "origin": "Grapploct appears to be based on an octopus with jujutsu fighter motifs; its connection to jujutsu is further supported by its category name. Its face design appears to be based on a wrestling mask, while the arm around its waist resembles a martial artist's belt. It may also reference octopus wrestling practices popular on the West Coast of the United States during the 1960s, which involved a diver grappling with a large octopus in shallow water and dragging it to the surface. Both Grapploct's normal and Shiny colors may be a reference to blue and white being the most common colors of gi worn by martial artists who practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Additionally, its Shiny variant's red colors may have been inspired by the red belt, the highest-ranking belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.",
    "description": "Grapploct is a blue, amphibious, octopus-like Pokémon with a yellow jagged eyemask-like marking, suckers, and what appears to be a breathing organ on the left side of its head, which can also be used to squirt out ink and perform special moves. It has a dark blue underside and cyan eyes. Four of its eight tentacles act as arms, three act as legs and one is wrapped around its waist. Its mouth is hidden under the bottom flap of its head. With a body made of pure muscle, Grapploct possesses very powerful grip strength. It enjoys fighting opponents, and moves onto the land to fight them before returning to its ocean home. Golisopod is the natural predator or prey of Grapploct, depending on who wins the fight. Grapploct is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Octolock."
