    "descripcion": "Grapploct is a blue, amphibious, octopus-like Pokémon with a yellow jagged eyemask-like marking, suckers, and what appears to be a breathing organ on the left side of its head, which can also be used to squirt out ink and perform special moves. It has a dark blue underside and cyan eyes. Four of its eight tentacles act as arms, three act as legs and one is wrapped around its waist. Its mouth is hidden under the bottom flap of its head. With a body made of pure muscle, Grapploct possesses very powerful grip strength. It enjoys fighting opponents, and moves onto the land to fight them before returning to its ocean home. Golisopod is the natural predator or prey of Grapploct, depending on who wins the fight. Grapploct is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Octolock."
