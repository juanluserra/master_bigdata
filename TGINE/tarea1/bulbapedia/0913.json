    "descripcion": "Quaxwell is a white, duck-like Pokémon. Its face has blue eyes, a pointed yellow beak, and a teal brow just above it which flares into two large branches flanking a small bump in the middle. On top of Quaxwell's head is a round blue crest twice as large, which droops towards the back. Various blue and teal-colored feathers also adorn its chest, forearms, tail, and the insides of its feet. The three feathers at the end of its arms are similar to fingers. Quaxwell's legs are long and its feet are yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes. The crest above Quaxwell's head is capable of absorbing impacts, and is used by Quaxwell to shield itself from incoming attacks. Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape.[1] Quaxwell has a serious, stoic personality, though it is also known to be temperamental. It learns and practices dance routines by observing the movements of people and Pokémon from various regions. Quaxwell is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. Flocks of Quaxwell train by running their legs through shallow waters, and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks.[1] As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Quaxwell maintains its beautiful posture. However, the daily training it maintains can occasionally leave it too tired to care for its coif. As a result, the coif is usually left messy as it sleeps."
