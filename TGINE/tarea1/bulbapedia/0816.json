    "descripcion": "Sobble is a small lizard-like Pok√©mon. It has light-blue skin, with darker blue patches on its cheeks and the tip of its curled tail, and a lighter blue belly and face. It has white eyes with dark blue irises. It also has a yellow fin on the top of its head, held by a dark blue spine. Sobble has thin limbs, each of them ending in two curved hands resembling those of a chameleon. It can use these to stick to walls and easily climb them. Sobble can run around as both a quadruped and a biped, and use its forelimbs as arms. It has the ability to change the patterns and colors on its body when touching water, allowing it to camouflage itself. Sobble is known to be very cautious in nature. Due to being a bit timid, when Sobble gets nervous or embarrassed, it secretes water from its body like sweat in order to disappear into its surroundings. If Sobble feels threatened, it will start bawling and spreading its tears around the area. These tears are said to be as potent as 100 onions, and can cause anyone near it to start crying uncontrollably, which it will use as a distraction in order to escape.[1] By eating berries, it can shoot opponents down with bullets of water it spurts from its mouth. It has perfect aim with these water attacks. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
