    "pokemon": "Pidgeotto",
    "pokedex_number": "0017",
    "origin": "Despite its name, Pidgeotto does not resemble a pigeon so much as a bird of prey such as an osprey or an eagle due to its large size and predatory behavior. It also shares some characteristics with various passerine birds such as sparrows, chickadees, waxwings, and wrens. Its red crest is somewhat similar to the crests of cockatoos. The black markings around its eyes are reminiscent of Ra and Horus, the sun and sky gods of Egyptian mythology who were depicted with the heads of falcons.",
    "description": "Pidgeotto is a raptor-like avian Pokémon. It is covered with brown feathers and has a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers. It has a crest of pinkish-red feathers on its head and black, angular markings behind its black eyes. The plumage of its tail has alternating red and yellow feathers with ragged tips. Pidgeotto's beak and legs are pink. Two of its toes point forward, while one points backward. Additionally, it has powerful, sharp talons that it uses to grasp prey. Pidgeotto is a powerful flier capable of carrying prey several miles to its nest. It has amazing vision, which helps it locate preferred prey Pokémon such as Exeggcute and Magikarp. The Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon depicts it preying on Caterpie. Pidgeotto claims a sprawling territory of more than 60 miles (100 kilometers), which it defends fiercely. Its nest is usually in the center of its territory and it circles its territory throughout the day, looking out for food and intruders. It is most often found in temperate forests. In Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
