    "pokemon": "Beldum",
    "pokedex_number": "0374",
    "origin": "Beldum seems to be a magnetic robot based on a dumbbell. It also resembles a limb of a Metang or Metagross, a reference to how it evolves.",
    "description": "Beldum is a robotic Pok√©mon that has a long body with a set of claws sticking out of its rear end. It has one large, red eye in the center of its nearly spherical head, which is set into a ball-and-socket joint at its front end. A short crest projects from its body and extends over its head. Even though Beldum is mechanical, it still has emotions, the need to eat, and a way of reproducing. Beldum's body lacks blood, and is instead made of cells that are all magnets. It uses magnetism to move, communicate, and control its attacks. Beldum sometimes gathers in swarms, communicating with each other telepathically and magnetically and moving in sync. When enraged, it can cause nearby machines to break from its strong magnetism. Beldum can also use its magnetic force to rapidly pull in enemies and then use its sharp claws to harm them. Beldum is scarce in the wild, but it does tend to inhabit areas with rugged terrain. It anchors itself to a cliff using its hooks when it sleeps."
