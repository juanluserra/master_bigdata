    "descripcion": "Toxtricity is a bipedal, lizard or salamander-like Pokémon with two forms. Both Amped Form and Low Key Form Toxtricity have purple-colored bodies and white eyes with black irises. Both forms also have four spikes on the back, four spikes on each wrist, and a crescent-shaped body part with seven spikes on the waist. By clawing at the organs on their chests, both forms of Toxtricity can generate over 15,000 volts of electricity, as well as sound. The sounds they make resemble those of electric string instruments: a standard guitar for Amped Form, and a bass guitar for Low Key Form. Toxtricity chugs stagnant water to absorb the dissolved toxins, which it then breaks down in order to generate electricity. Toxtricity is very popular with several youths who admired the way it listlessly picks fights with foe it faces and keeping its cool no matter what. Toxtricity is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Overdrive, as well as the only known Pokémon that can have Punk Rock as an Ability."
