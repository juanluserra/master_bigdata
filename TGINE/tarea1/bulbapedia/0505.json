    "pokemon": "Watchog",
    "pokedex_number": "0505",
    "origin": "Watchog's name suggests that it is based on a groundhog, although, like its pre-Evolution, it also resembles a chipmunk, meerkat or prairie dog. Its design is possibly based on a road worker, with the body resembling a protective suit and the yellow stripes forming a safety vest. Its penchant for moves that interrupt the standard flow of battle could allude to traffic guards and their ability to override the rules of the road.",
    "description": "Watchog is an upright, meerkat-like Pok√©mon with large cheeks and a single, pointed incisor sticking out of its mouth. It is mainly reddish-brown with beige cheeks and neck. There is yellow striping on its chest and tail. Its hands, feet, and tail tip are white. Its red eyes have small black pupils and a yellow stripe. Black markings accentuate the eyes at their outer ends. Its tail is almost exclusively depicted standing up straight, although it can also be kept in a relaxed position.[1] There are luminescent compounds in Watchog's body that allow its stripes and eyes to glow. It uses this ability to threaten predators. Its cheeks can hold a large amount of seeds, which it collects and spits at its opponents. Watchog possess night vision and can view its surroundings in the darkness."
