    "descripcion": "Maractus is a cactus-like Pokémon, with a pair of large ear-like extensions emerging from its head, reminiscent of cactus arms. These extensions feature dark green spiky arrangements at the base, yellow spikes midway up, and are topped with flowers composed of six pink petals and a yellow center. It has a yellow spike on its forehead, yellow eyes, and a spiky-looking mouth. It has two lobe-like arms resembling those of cacti, and its hands each feature three yellow spines serving as fingers. Other dark green spiky arrangements adorn its neck, wrists, and the base of its body where the green spikes are arranged in a five-pointed star. When Maractus moves its body rhythmically, it emits sounds reminiscent of maracas being played. This allows Maractus to produce up-tempo songs and dances that it can use to scare away predators. Avian Pokémon in particular may try to feed on its flower seeds. Once a year, Maractus scatters its nutrient-rich seeds across the desert, serving as a precious food source for other desert-dwelling Pokémon."
