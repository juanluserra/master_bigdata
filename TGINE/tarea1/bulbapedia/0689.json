    "pokedex_number": "0689",
    "origin": "Barbaracle seems to be based on the goose barnacle, due to their general shape and use of a connective \"stalk\" to cling to rocks. Considering one \"main\" Barbaracle survives together with others, it may possibly reference to the rarer, same species symbiosis, in particular conjunctive symbiosis due to their fusion into a single body. Considering its hand-like limbs and bodies, and its eyes within its many hands' \"palms\", it may have also been based on the hamsa. Its limbs having minds of their own may be a reference to alien hand syndrome. Barbaracle having numerous eyes across various parts of the body maybe possibly be a reference to various mythological entities with a myriad of eyes such as the Greek giant Argus and Japanese legends such as the Hyakume or the Dodomeki.",
    "description": "Barbaracle is a bipedal Pok√©mon with a body that consists of two gray rocks connected by an orange, segmented waist. It has four orange arms connected to the upper rock. Its head is brown and resembles a left fist; there are four clawed fingers on top and a clawed thumb on its right cheek. Its face is orange with two eyes but no other distinguishable features. Each arm has a brown hand with a single eye in the center of the palm, four long claws, and a brown band around the middle. Its legs are also orange but have two brown bands and brown feet with four claws and a four-pointed star on the soles. Through evolution, two Binacle have multiplied into seven. Each limb thinks for itself and moves independently, though they usually follow the head's orders. Since each limb has an eye, it is able to see in all directions at once."
