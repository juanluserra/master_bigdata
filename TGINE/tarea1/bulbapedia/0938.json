    "descripcion": "Tadbulb is a small amphibian Pok√©mon with a spherical yellow head that takes up most of its body. This head has two white spots at the top and can emit light, and Tadbulb blinks it on and off to warn its allies. On the bottom of the head is Tadbulb's face, which is black with beady yellow eyes, a simple mouth with orange lips, and yellow circles on its cheeks. Tadbulb's head and tail are separated by copper-colored discs below the head. Tadbulb's tail is black with a U-shaped copper-colored pattern at the tip, and is used by Tadbulb to generate electricity by shaking it. Tadbulb can generate and store enough electricity to power cities such as Levincia. It is also capable of using electricity to float in the air; if the weather is stormy, it can float at a higher altitude. Tadbulb are known to inhabit wetlands and riverbanks."
