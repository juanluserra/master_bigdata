    "pokemon": "Sinistea",
    "pokedex_number": "0854",
    "origin": "Sinistea is based on a ghost (possibly a poltergeist, a mischievous ghost that possesses objects) possessing a cup of tea,[4] which has historical and cultural significance in the United Kingdom, the country Galar is based on. The way Sinistea holds its own cup references a way of holding a teacup with one's pinky finger sticking out,[5] which is commonly and erroneously believed to be part of tea drinking etiquette. Additionally, the bit of tea hanging from Sinistea's rim resembles both a tongue and a tea bag tag.",
    "description": "Sinistea is a Pokémon said to be created when a lonely spirit possesses a cold, leftover cup of tea. It is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. The teacup that Sinistea lives in is a famous piece of antique tableware; seafoam green in color with gold rims and a lacy pattern that resembles a face. However, there are many forgeries in circulation. The swirl pattern on Sinistea's purple body serves as a weakness. Should a Sinistea get stirred, the swirl will disappear and cause it to get dizzy. Sinistea can absorb the life force of anyone who drinks it. While it can wait patiently, most of Sinistea's opportunities end up being short, as it tastes so bad that it is spat out immediately. Sinistea inhabits hotels and homes. The Antique Form of Sinistea is highly sought after by certain enthusiasts. These collectors dedicate considerable time and effort to prepare the perfect tea and teacup, hoping that a Sinistea will come and possess their selections. Poltchageist bears a resemblance to Sinistea, although the two species are biologically unrelated."
