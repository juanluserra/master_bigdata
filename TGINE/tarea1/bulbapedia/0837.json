    "descripcion": "Rolycoly is a Pokémon which resembles a small piece of coal. It has a single orange-red eye that can light up and illuminate dark areas,[1] while the rest of its body is black. It has a rugged exterior and lacks any limbs. Its lower body has a wheel-like leg, which it rolls on and uses for movement, in a similar fashion to a unicycle. Rolycoly was first discovered around 400 years ago in coal mines. It races around on grassy plains and the rough, rocky terrain in coal mines and caves, burning through the coal that sustains it. Rolycoly's diet also includes grass that gets tangled in its leg. Until about 100 years ago, every household in Galar had a Rolycoly, using the coal that it drops for cooking and heating up homes. Rolycoly's popularity continues even into the modern-day, as it is used for outdoor activities.[1] Dwebble is Rolycoly's natural enemy, as the former tends to think that Rolycoly is an inanimate rock to turn into a home. Rolycoly and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Steam Engine as an Ability."
