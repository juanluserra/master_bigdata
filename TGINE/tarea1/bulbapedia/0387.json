    "descripcion": "Turtwig is a small, light green, quadrupedal Pokémon resembling a turtle or tortoise. Its eyes, feet, and lower jaw are yellow. Its body is covered by a brown shell that is composed of earth. The shell has a thick black stripe and a black rim. On a very healthy Turtwig, the shell should feel moist. A small seedling grows on a brown patch on its head. This seedling will wilt if the Pokémon becomes thirsty. Since it is a plant-based Pokémon, Turtwig usually nourishes itself through photosynthesis; it becomes more energetic when exposed to enough sunlight. It also drinks water, which hardens its soil-based shell. Due to its status as a first partner Pokémon, a wild Turtwig is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
