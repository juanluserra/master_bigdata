    "pokemon": "Wugtrio",
    "pokedex_number": "0961",
    "origin": "Wugtrio appears to be based on garden eels. The fact that it physically resembles Dugtrio may be a reference to convergent evolution or parallel evolution, which can lead to separate organisms independently developing similar or identical characteristics and body plans. Its habit of dragging its prey into its den is similar to how moray eels hunt. Its simplistic anatomy, lack of fins, strong sense of smell, and Gooey Ability may draw inspiration from hagfish. Its appearance and silhouette may also derive slight cues from giant tube worms and tubifex worms.",
    "description": "Wugtrio is a long, red, three-bodied fish Pokémon that lives in a black spiky rock. Each body has a head with beady dark blue eyes and a large, round, white nose. Only Wugtrio's heads and parts of its bodies are seen; it is unknown what the rest of its body looks like inside of the rock. Wugtrio makes its habitat on coastlines and hides within its rock when spotted by humans. It is considered a particularly aggressive Pokémon species, wrapping its three bodies around prey and dragging them down to its lair. It was originally thought to be a regional form of Dugtrio, but this has since been disproven. Wugtrio is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Triple Dive."
