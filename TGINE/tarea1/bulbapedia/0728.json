    "descripcion": "Popplio is a pinniped Pokémon that is primarily blue. It has large eyes, a long, white snout with black whiskers, and a round, pink nose. There is a small, rounded earflap on each side of its head. Around its neck is a light blue ruff, which extends past its shoulders. It has four flippers. The front flippers are larger than the hind and have white markings separating its toes. Popplio can snort bubbles of water from its nose, which it uses as part of its battle strategy. On land, it uses the elasticity of its bubbles to perform acrobatic stunts and jumps. Popplio practices daily with increasingly larger water bubbles. The sheer force of their bubbles bursting can deal a lot of damage. It can swim at 25 mph (40 km/h)[1] Popplio has complete control of its water bubbles. Popplio is famous for its hard-working nature. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. Popplio and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Liquid Voice as an Ability."
