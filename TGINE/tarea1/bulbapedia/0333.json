    "pokemon": "Swablu",
    "pokedex_number": "0333",
    "origin": "Swablu may be based on a bluebird combined with cotton or a cloud. It also shares traits more specifically with the ultramarine lorikeet. Behaviorally, it is similar to the Canada jay in that they are both given to sitting on people's heads.",
    "description": "Swablu is an avian Pok√©mon with a round, blue body. Since it has no discernible neck, its body appears to be all head. There are two long feathers on top of its head, and it has a short, rounded white beak and beady, black eyes. Its wings are fluffy and white, resembling cotton or clouds and are made of air. The wings have a light and fluffy feel. It has tiny, white feet and two pointed tail feathers. Swablu does not like dirty surroundings, so it cleans things with its cottony wings diligently. It uses streams, freshwater springs, or a manmade shower to wash its wings when they become dirty from polishing. It is commonly found living in flocks in forested habitats, but often flies closer to towns during the spring. Swablu is very friendly and largely unafraid of humans. As a result, it frequently perches on people's heads like a fluffy hat. Swablu can easily hide from foes in clouds thanks to its appearance. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Swablu is known to sleep curled up with its wings folded. Swablu is believed to dreaming about perching atop someone's head."
