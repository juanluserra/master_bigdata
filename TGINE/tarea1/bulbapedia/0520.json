    "pokemon": "Tranquill",
    "pokedex_number": "0520",
    "origin": "Tranquill is based on an oriental turtle dove.[1] Judging from its Pokédex entries, Tranquill may also be based on the homing pigeon, a domestic pigeon bred to find its way home over extremely long distances. Its design is similar to that of the greater roadrunner or secretarybird.",
    "description": "Tranquill is a gray avian Pokémon with lighter gray and black markings. Its beak and eyes are yellow, and there is a dark pink marking above its beak that curves over the eyes. It has a black tuft of two feathers on its head and a petal-like arrangement of feathers on the nape of its neck. There is a black stripe on each of its light gray, black-tipped wings. Each of its pink feet has black talons. It possesses a long tail feather that is tipped in black. Tranquill has an acute memory, and no matter how far it travels, it is always able to return to its Trainer and nest. It is said to live in deep forests, where there is a peaceful place without war. It is often used as partners for delivery workers."
