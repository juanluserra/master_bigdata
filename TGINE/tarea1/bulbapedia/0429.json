    "pokemon": "Mismagius",
    "pokedex_number": "0429",
    "origin": "Mismagius seems to be based on the concept of mages and witches. Mismagius's coloration might be a reference to the Nasu-babā, a witch-like yōkai with a distinct purple skin. Its shape also resembles the Teru teru bōzu. Its Pokédex descriptions of its cries sounding like incantations and tormenting people are reminiscent of curses. Another possible source of origin is the banshee, a female spirit from Irish mythology, known in modern media for its unearthly wailing and screaming.",
    "description": "Mismagius is a purple, ghost-like Pokémon. It has a round head with elaborate tufts resembling a witch's hat atop it. The tips of the tufts are paler than most of the body. It has a thin, red mouth that resembles the letter \"W.\" Below its head, Mismagius has a short, thorax-like lump from which its body connects. Three elliptical red spheres surround the upper portion of Mismagius's body. There are extensions on the sides of its lower body with the foremost ones tattered compared to rear ones. This gives Mismagius the appearance of wearing some kind of cloak. Mismagius usually shows up without warning to cause havoc on unsuspecting humans or Pokémon. If it is powerful, Mismagius can use advanced incantations for various purposes, such as causing misery or happiness. Due to this, people often seek to capture Mismagius as if their life depends on it, solely to make someone fall in love with them. There is a custom on inviting Mismagius to one's home, usually to ward off misfortune with its spells. However, this can also lead to disaster should Mismagius ever be provoked. People that hear its cries will usually receive headaches and hallucinations. As shown in the Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Malice In Wonderland!, Mismagius can put its victims to sleep, and cause them to enter a strange dream world without their noticing. If Mismagius falls asleep or is knocked out, the victim will wake up. It can sometimes be found roaming around lakes and mountainsides at night."
