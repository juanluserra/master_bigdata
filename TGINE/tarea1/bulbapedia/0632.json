    "pokemon": "Durant",
    "pokedex_number": "0632",
    "origin": "Durant is based on an ant.[1] It may specifically be based on the trap-jaw ant for its prominent jaws, or either the silver spiny sugar ant (Polyrhachis schlueteri) or the Saharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina) for their silver colorations. Its Steel-type might have been chosen to be weak to its rival anteater Pokémon's type, Heatmor, which is Fire-type and has a tongue made out of flames. Durant's Hidden Ability, Truant, may be a reference to scientific research showing that some ants are lazy, while its second standard Ability, Hustle, may be a reference to hard-working ants.",
    "description": "Durant is an insectoid Pokémon with a steel body that has three distinct sections. Its ovoid abdomen is dark gray with a light gray band wrapping around the middle and two circles resembling rivets near a jagged seam. Durant's thorax is slightly smaller, but identical in design with its abdomen. The only difference being one circle instead of two. Its head is spherical, containing the same light gray wrap design as its body. However, it wraps from front to back on the head. On each side of its head are large red eyes with hollow black pupils. Durant has two round mandibles that it uses to grab things and feed itself. The mandibles are attached below its eyes and are situated in front of its horizontally opening mouth. Atop its head are two long antennae, each tipped with small spheres. Durant has six black legs sprouting from its thorax. Each leg has one claw at its tip, except the front legs that each have two. Durant is extremely territorial. It only lives in colonies and digs mazes underground designed to be as complicated as possible. It grows steel armor to protect itself from its natural predator Heatmor. When they are under attack, Durant gathers in groups to attack as a whole to keep Heatmor away. They also gather together when protecting their eggs from Sandaconda. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Battling the Leaf Thieves!, Durant prefers to eat vegetation, namely leaves. It will attack swiftly and aggressively if bothered, but will not pursue intruders once outside of its colony."
