    "descripcion": "Druddigon is a large, blue, draconic Pokémon with medium-sized wings shaped like thistle leaves, although it is rarely seen flying. Its bright red head is harder than rock and is very rough. It has a set of glaring, ferocious pale yellow irises. Its arms are longer than its legs, giving it the appearance of a hunchback. It has a thick, moderately-sized tail and sharp white claws on both the hands and feet. It also has tall, conical, red spikes: three on each arm, one on each shoulder, two on each leg, and four on its tail. It has a blunt, brutal snout, bearing a maw with no discernible teeth; instead, small fang-like protrusions sprout from its jaws. It has a series of olive, ellipsoid scutes running across its belly. Druddigon is known to be vicious and cunning. It warms its body by taking in sunlight with its wings; if its body temperature lowers, it becomes immobile. It has savage physical strength; it nimbly chases prey around its den, using its outstretched claws to catch them, or charging into them face-first. Instead of making its own nest, it lives in caves and tunnels dug out by other Pokémon, such as Diglett, Dugtrio, Onix, and Excadrill."
