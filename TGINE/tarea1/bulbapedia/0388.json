    "descripcion": "Grotle is a quadrupedal turtle Pokémon with light green skin and a large shell covering its back. The shell is composed of hardened soil and conforms to the shape of Grotle's body, extending from its forehead to the tip of its short tail. The shell appears sectioned and is yellow with three long, brown ridges atop it. Two bush-like trees are growing around the outermost ridges. Grotle's lower jaw is yellow and has triangular extensions on the cheeks, while its upper jaw has a hooked tip. Its feet are yellow and have three claws each. Grotle can sense where pure water wells are and will carry other Pokémon on its back to these sources. Each Grotle has a secret place for getting clean spring water. It lives in forests but leaves during the day to allow more sunlight on its trees. Grotle has also been observed living near clean spring water. Berries grow on the trees, attracting some species of Pokémon. The berries it grows are said to be sweet and very delicious. In Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl[what episode?], Grotle is seen to produce acorn-like nuts instead."
