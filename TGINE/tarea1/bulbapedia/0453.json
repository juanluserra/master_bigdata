    "origin": "Croagunk may have been based on the poison dart frog. The white markings around its midsection resemble sarashi, with the differing placement between male and female Croagunk corresponding to different styles worn by men and women.",
    "description": "Croagunk is a dark ultramarine-blue, bipedal Pokémon that resembles a poison dart frog. It has yellow eyes, which are surrounded by black markings. There are orange, expandable pouches on its cheeks, and its teeth are wide and flat. A black marking encircles its upper arms and chest, and there are white bands around its chest. The white markings are slightly higher up on the female Croagunk than the male. It has three fingers and toes, most of which are black. The only digits that are not black are its center fingers, which are orange instead. Croagunk's cheek pouches and fingers contain a poisonous fluid. However, the fluid squeezed from its finger is also a significant ingredient in remedies for lower back pain once diluted. The cheek pouches can be used to create an unnerving sound. When its opponents are distracted, it tries to stab them with its fingers. Despite this, it fights others only to ensure its own survival. Croagunk is a popular Pokémon due to being chosen as a mascot for a pharmaceutical company. It is also popular thanks to its strange cry and comical look. Croagunk and its evolved form, Toxicroak, are related to Seismitoad. Croagunk is said to have a dastardly nature, due to wielding poison. It usually lives in swamps and forested areas. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Croagunk has been observed inflating its poison sack cheeks while sleeping. On occasion, the sound from its poison sacs will wake it up."
