    "pokemon": "Volbeat",
    "pokedex_number": "0313",
    "origin": "Volbeat appears to be based on a lampyridae (also known as a glowworm, firefly, or lightningbug) like its counterpart, Illumise. Its coloring resembles the subfamily Cyphonocerinae. Its appearance may also be based on a greaser, a subculture in the 1950s; their Japanese counterparts are the Bōsōzoku. Greasers usually wore black or brown Y-collared trench-coats and/or jackets with under shirts and also had heavily greased hair. This is shown in Volbeat's black colored \"shirt\", striped belly \"under shirt\" and \"collar\". The pose Volbeat takes in its official art may also be a reference to greasers, as they are commonly shown with their hands either holding or popping their jacket collars.",
    "description": "Volbeat is a firefly-like, bipedal Pokémon. Its body is black with a blue chest and abdomen. There are two yellow stripes across its front: one on its chest and one near its legs. A red band separates each limb from its body and a thicker, incomplete one surrounds its shoulders. Two simple wings extend from the band around its shoulder. It has a blue face with yellow eyes, and curly, yellow antennae with black stripes. It has a spherical yellow tail, which glows to communicate and draw geometric patterns in the sky while in a swarm. In Generation III, Tail Glow was its signature move. This is a male only species; Illumise is its female counterpart. Volbeat is attracted by the sweet aroma given off by Illumise. It lives in forests near clean ponds, but will move if the pond becomes dirty."
