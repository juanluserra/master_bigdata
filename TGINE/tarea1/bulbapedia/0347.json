    "pokemon": "Anorith",
    "pokedex_number": "0347",
    "origin": "Anorith appears to be closely based on an Anomalocaris with some characteristics of a trilobite. It greatly resembles brine shrimp as well, having similar eyes and feather-like protrusions on its sides.",
    "description": "Anorith is a greenish-gray, arthropod Pokémon that resembles an anomalocaris. A stalk extends from either side of its head, with large, spherical eyes at the tips. The middle of its head is black with two red, teardrop-shaped markings, and an X-shaped mouth is visible on the underside of its torso. Beneath its head are two large, segmented claws that serve as weapons and are used to capture prey. On each side of its body are four white appendages with red tips. These wing-like projections are used to propel Anorith through the water. Now extinct in the wild, it lived in the seas of ancient times 100,000,000 years ago. While still extinct, it has been seen under the ownership of Trainers as a result of being revived from Claw Fossils. Despite this, Anorith can no longer thrive in today's oceans because the water composition has changed since ancient times. Anorith can swim easily through the seas using its eight wings like oars from a boat. Anorith is considered the ancestor of modern bug Pokémon."
