    "descripcion": "Greninja is a bipedal, frog-like Pok√©mon. It is mostly dark blue with a yellow chest, a white triangular marking over each eye, a light blue four-pointed star on each thigh, and yellow on the lower half of its face. It has red eyes with white pupils and its mouth is hidden behind a large, pink tongue that wraps around its neck and extends outward behind its head. Running down the middle of its head is a fin-like extension, and there is a similar fin on each side of its head. Light blue webbing connects its head fins. There is a large, white bubble-like bump on each elbow and knee. Its back feet have two toes, while its front feet have three toes. Each digit has a bulbous tip and yellow webbing. Greninja's movements are swift, rapid and graceful, akin to those of ninja.[1] It uses this speed to confound enemies while slicing them up. It can compress water into various weapons to slice up enemies, most commonly in the form of its Water Shuriken, though it has been shown creating water katana and water kunai in both the animated series and the Super Smash Bros. video game series. It can also create shuriken from the mucus it excretes from its thighs for sharp projectiles that can split through metal. As seen in the animated series, Greninja's tongue is extremely long and many times its own height, and strong enough to catch and hold an average human. However, it usually keeps its tongue wrapped around its neck like a scarf. Doing so exposes its tongue to air movements, allowing Greninja to detect enemies it otherwise could not see. In Generation VI, Mat Block was its signature move. In Generation IX, Water Shuriken is its signature move."
