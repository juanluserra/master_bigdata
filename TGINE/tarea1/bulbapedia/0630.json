    "pokemon": "Mandibuzz",
    "pokedex_number": "0630",
    "origin": "Mandibuzz may be based on an Old World vulture, most closely resembling a lappet-faced vulture with the prominent ruff of a white-rumped vulture. Its design also bears resemblance to stereotypical \"savages\", barbarians, or cavemen. The row of teeth around its waist resembles an apron.",
    "description": "Mandibuzz is a vulture-like Pokémon, particularly resembling a turkey vulture. It has a bare, pink head and neck, along with a notched black beak and red eyes. There are black eyelashes or eyeliner-like markings above its eyes. A long brown tuft with a bone in the middle extends from the back of its head. It has a tan ruff at the base of its neck, and shaggy darker brown wings with gray tips. Mandibuzz also has shaggy brown tail feathers. Its pink feet have black talons. It has decorated itself with bones — a jaw with sharp teeth — to form a skirt. When Mandibuzz sits on its Vullaby chick within its nest, Mandibuzz's bony skirt combines with the bones around Vullaby's lower body to form an upside-down skull with sharp teeth.[1] Different types of bones fall in and out of use as if there were fashion trends among Mandibuzz. Mandibuzz lives in nests made from the bones it finds, though they have also been seen using more traditional nests, such as in the Terarium. Weakened prey such as Cubone is dragged back to this nest after Mandibuzz swoops down on it from the sky. Mandibuzz is a female-only species, although it dresses attractively in bones as a fruitless attempt to attract mates."
