    "descripcion": "Mareep is an ovine Pokémon with fluffy cream-colored wool covering its entire body, as well as a curly tuft of wool in the middle of its head. Its head is blue, and it has black eyes. Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times. Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern. Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb. This sphere glows brighter the more electricity and heat it has. Mareep's wool grows continuously and stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battles in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used to make high-quality clothing. Clothing made from Mareep's wool builds up static electricity easily, and as such, a special process has to be used on it. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Mareep is known to roll over in its sleep.[1]"
