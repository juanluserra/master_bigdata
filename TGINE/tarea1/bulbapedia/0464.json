    "descripcion": "Rhyperior is a large, brownish-gray Pokémon with two horns: a larger one on its nose, and smaller one above it. The upper horn is even smaller on a female Rhyperior. The larger horn is divided into three sections by two thin slanted rings, making the horn resemble a drill. Its hide is partially covered by orange, rocky plates on its head, shoulders, arms, waist, and knees, similar to that of the protector used to evolve it from Rhydon. The hide of Rhyperior's armor has a mysterious substance. It has blade-like protrusions on its elbows and has holes in the palms of its hands which work as cannons or guns. It has three blunt, gray fingers on each hand, two gray toes on each foot, and a club-like tail. Its eyes have red irises with what appears be two thick, rectangular rocks above each one, resembling heavy eyebrows. Rhyperior is even stronger than Rhydon, although its brain structure is smaller. It can insert rocks and boulders into its arms through the holes in its hands and fire them as projectiles. Occasionally, it will insert and fire Geodude or Roggenrola by accident. Rhyperior has a very hard carapace; it can survive volcanic eruptions, cannot be scratched even by a masterwork sword, and deflect most incoming attacks. This can throw the opponent off balance before it drills into the foe. Rhyperior lives far up in the mountains. Prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, Rhyperior is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Rock Wrecker."
