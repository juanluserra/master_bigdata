    "pokemon": "Exploud",
    "pokedex_number": "0295",
    "origin": "Exploud seems to be based on a pipe organ, a musical instrument known for its loud volume and many tubes. It may also draw inspiration from various other wind instruments, horns, loudspeakers, or a megaphone. The shape of its head is similar to the frills of ceratopsid skulls, most notably Styracosaurus while its mouth and teeth are similar of the jaws of a hippopotamus. The curved yellow markings on its stomach and back resemble the stylized sound waves on a volume icon.",
    "description": "Exploud is a blue, bipedal Pok√©mon with a large mouth. It has red eyes, a stubby nose, and two peg-like teeth in each jaw. It has protruding tubes with holes along its body: seven forming a crest on top of its head, one on each elbow and knee, two along its back, and one at the end of each of its two tails. The tubes along its head-crest and tails are tipped with yellow, while the ones along its back have yellow semicircular patterns on either side. There are two yellow semicircle markings on its belly, but they are rarely seen due to its giant mouth. Its arms have three thin stripes below its elbow and three fingers. Each foot has four claws, three in the front and one in the back, and a yellow paw pad. Exploud uses the tubes on its body to draw in air and increase its noise-based attacks. Its bellowing is capable of triggering earthquakes and can be heard from over six miles away. While it only raises its voice when it is in battle, it can also communicate its feelings to others by producing whistle-like sounds. In the past, Exploud was used by distant cities as a way of communication. It lives in caves."
