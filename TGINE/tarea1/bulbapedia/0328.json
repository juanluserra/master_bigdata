    "pokemon": "Trapinch",
    "pokedex_number": "0328",
    "origin": "Trapinch appears to be based on the larval stage of the antlion, which live in conical sandy pits before maturing into winged adults. Its head resembles a cartoonish depiction of foothold traps.",
    "description": "Trapinch is an orange, insectoid Pok√©mon. It has a round body with a white underside and four stumpy legs. It also has a proportionally large head, small black eyes with twinkle-shaped pupils, and a zigzagging mouth. Trapinch's large jaws are powerful enough to crush any boulders that get in its way as it digs through the sand of the arid deserts in which it lives. It can go a week without water or food. Instead of actively hunting prey, it digs into the sand to build its bowl- or cone-shaped nests, waiting for prey to tumble inside and become trapped. When night falls, Trapinch will dig itself a spot underneath the sand and go to sleep. Due to the size of its head in contrast to its small body, Trapinch will be unable to get up after flipping over onto its back, making it vulnerable to natural predators such as Sandile."
