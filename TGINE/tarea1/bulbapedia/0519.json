    "descripcion": "Pidove is a mainly gray, pigeon-like Pokémon. It has golden, oval eyes and a tuft of feathers atop its rounded head. It has a short, black beak with a bulbous pink cere, and a black patch on the nape of its neck. There is a wide, heart-shaped area of lighter coloration on its chest. Pidove's black wings have a thick gray stripe down the side. It has pink feet with black talons. Pidove is not particularly intelligent. While it always listens to its Trainer's commands, it does not always understand them. Pidove are so forgetful that they will wait for new orders from their Trainers even if it received one right before. In Detective Pikachu, their forgetfulness extends to them not even remembering their own names. In the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode There's a New Kid in Town!, it extends to forgetting whatever scared them. Many Trainers love Pidove due to its friendliness and sincere nature. Pidove loves to follow people. Having no fear of people, flocks of Pidove are often found in city parks and plazas, though they can also be seen in grasslands and rural areas. The cooing of these flocks can be very noisy. About several hundred Pidove are known to gather when food is scattered on the ground for them."
