    "pokemon": "Flygon",
    "pokedex_number": "0330",
    "origin": "Flygon appears to be based on the winged, adult stage of the antlion. Oftentimes, the adult antlion and dragonfly are confused with one another, and Flygon could draw inspiration from both. In fact, some species of dragonflies are commonly called \"sand dragons\", which could account for Vibrava and Flygon's type combination. In keeping with its Dragon type, it also possesses a dragon-like build and reptilian features such as its arms and tail. Its goggle-like lenses hiding a small eye could be inspired by mantids and similar insects, which have large compound eyes with pseudopupils - commonly mistaken for a true pupil. The singing sound which this Pokémon produces and its connection to sand could be inspired by singing sand.",
    "description": "Flygon is a Pokémon that resembles a slightly insectoid, bipedal dragon. It is primarily light green and has a pair of large rhombus-shaped wings with red trim, toeless hind legs, and skinny arms with three-clawed hands. Flygon's tail has several dark green stripes and three small green rhombus shapes with red trims at the end. It has large eyes and a pair of green antennae that point back. Its eyes have red covers that prevent sand from getting into them. With its wings, it kicks up sandstorms to hide itself. Its wings make a \"singing\" sound when they are flapped, earning Flygon the name \"The Desert Spirit\". It uses this unique ability to attract prey, stranding them before it attacks. Flygon lives in the desert, and it typically works together with Krookodile in searching for food, whipping up sandstorms for Krookodile to hide in as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch."
