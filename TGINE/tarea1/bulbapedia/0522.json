    "descripcion": "Blitzle is a black, zebra-like Pokémon with thick, double-pointed white stripes on its neck, chest, back, and hind legs. It has a rounded muzzle with a large, dark nose and oval, blue eyes with yellow sclerae. On top of its head are short, triangular ears with blue insides. Below the knees, its legs are white with black hooves. Its tail is stubby, white, and has two points. Running up its neck is a spiky, white mane, which culminates at the front in a long extension that resembles a lightning bolt. This mane captures and stores electricity, which flashes whenever this Pokémon discharges electricity from it. It communicates with other members of its species by controlling the rhythm and frequency of these flashes. Blitzle generates electricity with its heartbeat. Whenever Blitzle is startled, its heart rate goes up, and the voltage of its electricity rises with it. During lightning storms, Blitzle ventures out to recharge its mane with lightning bolts. For this reason, Blitzle tends to live in places with lots of lightning strikes. Blitzle lives in herds run by Zebstrika."
