    "pokemon": "Wormadam",
    "pokedex_number": "0413",
    "origin": "Wormadam appears to be based on an adult female bagworm moth, which never develops wings and remains in its cocoon lifelong. The Trash Cloak form specifically appears to be made of fiberglass insulation, a wool-like padding that is often dyed pink. The idea of a cloak made from household materials may be inspired by household casebearer moths, whose larvae exhibit the same cloaking behaviour as bagworms, and make cloaks from dust, hair, and dirt they scavenge from homes.",
    "description": "Wormadam is a black, bagworm-like Pokémon with a coat of plants, sand, or garbage, the last of which resembles building insulation. It has oval eyes, a long pointed beak, and a long antenna with a coiled tip. The beak is tipped with varying colors depending on the coat. The coat forms a pair of arm-like structures near this Pokémon's head. It is a female-only species, with Mothim as its male counterpart."
