    "descripcion": "Phanpy is a small, horizon-blue proboscid Pokémon that resembles a baby elephant. It has large, floppy ears, which it uses as fans to cool itself. There are two red pads on each ear and another on the bridge of its short trunk. Phanpy has a single nail on each of its four feet, and a short tail. This small trunk is sensitive, yet strong. It can send a person flying with an affectionate, playful bump of its snout. The trunk is also strong enough to shatter any arm bones it hits. Additionally, this little Pokémon is easily capable of carrying an adult human on its back. Phanpy is found in rocky terrain. To make its nest, it digs a vertical pit near the edge of a river. It displays ownership of this area by marking it with its trunk. In the deserted morning hours, Phanpy uses its trunk to shower in the river. Sometimes, groups of this Pokémon form and soak each other thoroughly. Afterwards, it can be seen drying its body near the edge of the river. The reason is Phanpy won't settle down until it is clean."
