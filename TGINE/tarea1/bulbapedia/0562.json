    "descripcion": "Yamask is a shadow-like Pokémon holding a golden mask that has a face from its time as a human. It has two shadowy, tendril-like arms and large, red eyes. It also has a small tail-like appendage that holds the mask. Yamask is capable of speech when possessing a human, but not in its regular form. Due to being a human long ago, Yamask retains its memories from before it became a Pokémon. It becomes furious when the mask is lost or taken away. If someone wears the mask Yamask carries, they will become possessed by the Yamask in question. Sometimes, it looks at this mask and cries, apparently in longing. Yamask is known to wander the ruins of ancient civilizations. Yamask and its evolution, Cofagrigus, are the only known Pokémon that can have Mummy as an Ability."
