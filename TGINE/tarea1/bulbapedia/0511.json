    "pokemon": "Pansage",
    "pokedex_number": "0511",
    "origin": "Pansage is based on a monkey,[1] with the top of its head resembling a tree or vegetables such as broccoli. The fact that it is based on both may mean it might be based on the legends of monkey trees or possibly a visual pun on leaf monkeys.",
    "description": "Pansage is a simian, green-and-cream Pok√©mon. It has oval, black eyes, large ears with light green insides, and a tiny, black nose. There is a broccoli-like sprout atop its head. In the sprout's foliage are three yellow, tapered seed-like shapes. If eaten, the leaves in this sprout can alleviate exhaustion. Its muzzle, upper body, and skinny forelimbs are cream-colored, and its hands seem to have no fingers, aside from a thumb. Pansage's lower body is green with small feet, and its long tail is tipped with two leaves. Pansage dwells deep in the forest, where it collects berries to share with its friends."
