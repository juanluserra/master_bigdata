    "descripcion": "Okidogi is a bulky, bipedal canine Pokémon, with broad shoulders, pointy ears, and a large, fluffy tail. Its fur is almost entirely black, except for the green on its muzzle, face, chest, hands, back, waist, thighs, and feet. It has magenta crescent-shaped markings on its face, which also contains yellow eyes, a rounded magenta nose, and sharp teeth. Its ears have magenta insides, and its hands have five fingers each and magenta paw pads. Hanging around its neck is a magenta toxic chain that resembles a leash. Okidogi is a male-only species with no female counterpart. Okidogi, together with Munkidori and Fezandipiti, are known as the Loyal Three, the heroes of Kitakami. They are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes who once protected the land from the \"evil ogre\",[1] and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried.[2] According to locals, worshipping Okidogi will grant kindness and help ensure things are 'okey-dokey' between both sides. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Okidogi has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, Okidogi can become a Titanic Pokémon. In myth, it is said that Okidogi was once a smaller, weaker Pokémon. A desire for strength led it to meet the Mythical Pokémon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform Okidogi. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its neck, chaining Okidogi to Pecharunt's will. Okidogi transformed as the chain enhanced its capabilities, granting it a powerful physique by stimulating its muscles heavily.[3] The toxic chain, when thrown, is powerful enough to let Okidogi pulverize anything it hits. It is a ruffian with a short temper."
