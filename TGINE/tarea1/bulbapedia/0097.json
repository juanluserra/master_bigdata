    "pokemon": "Hypno",
    "pokedex_number": "0097",
    "origin": "Hypno may be based on a tapir, hypnotist, and baku, or dream eater spirit, of Japanese mythology. It also looks similar to a proboscis monkey. Aspects of Hypno's behavior also resemble various fairies, goblins, bogeymen, and other supernatural entities in European folklore.",
    "description": "Hypno is a bipedal, slightly humanoid Pokémon that has yellow skin. It has triangular ears with brown interiors, sleepy-looking eyes, and a large nose. On its neck, it has a ruff of white fur, which is longer on the female. Hypno has five fingers on each hand and holds a pendulum in its left. The pendulum resembles a flat, silver ring and is used for hypnotism. Hypno is never seen without it. It has three toes on each foot, which also have a pink pad on the undersides. Hypno is able to put people to sleep by swinging its pendulum. It is known to reside away from humans and on less-traveled roads. While it awaits its prey, it polishes its pendulum. If anyone comes by, Hypno will hypnotize them and eat their dreams. It carries away people having good dreams and is even known to have stolen a child at one point. However, in the Alola region, it preys primarily on Komala, and cases of Hypno targeting humans are notably rare. Some Hypno are even known to assist doctors in hospitals when their patients cannot sleep at night. In the Trainers' School in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, a Hypno is shown to be capable of creating illusions, namely by disguising itself as a human and causing illusory children to appear."
