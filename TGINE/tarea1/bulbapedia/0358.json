    "pokemon": "Chimecho",
    "pokedex_number": "0358",
    "origin": "Chimecho appears to be based on Japanese glass wind bells known as fūrin, which are hung around Shinto shrines to predict disasters and ward off evil spirits. Its red and white coloration is reminiscent of the dresses worn by miko.",
    "description": "Chimecho is a small, round Pokémon with a mainly bluish-white body shaped like a fūrin wind chime. It has beady, yellow eyes and three stubby limbs. Its body has a horizontal amaranth-colored pattern. Underneath its body extends a long, tag-like tail that has amaranth patterning at the bottom. A yellow, globular growth, referred to as a suction cup or a sucker, is connected to the top of its body. Chimecho can create ultrasonic sound waves and other noises. It uses seven different echoing cries to communicate with others. It is nocturnal and usually lives in grasslands and woods, but some are found in mountainous regions. An omnivorous species, it eats Berries that it plucks with its tail and can knock out large prey using powerful waves of air, which are thought to be created by Chimecho amplifying the faint sound of wind inside its body."
