    "pokemon": "Klinklang",
    "pokedex_number": "0601",
    "origin": "Klinklang is based on interlocking gears,[2] perhaps specifically a combination of sun and planet gears, a bevel gear, and an external gear. Its appearance may also be based on a balance wheel. The red core of one of the wheels could be a reference to the jewel bearings in mechanical watches, which are often made out of ruby.",
    "description": "Klinklang is a Pokémon resembling four interlocking gears, with six teeth on the smaller two gears and eight teeth on the larger gear. The fourth gear is on its lower side, and is red-topped with a thin, spiked rim below it. The red core is used to store energy gained from the rotating gears. This energy can be released through the spiked gear at the bottom. The teeth of the smaller gears are a light gray, while their central regions are much darker. The teeth of the larger gear are a medium gray and its central region is darker. The left eye of the smaller gear is a white \"X\", while its right eye has a black pupil and a white sclera. It has a round green nose and a small mouth. The largest gear appears to have a face with a black square for its right eye, a black circle for its left eye, and a sharply angled white frown. Dialogue between the two faced gears in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series suggests that both gears are independently sentient from one another.[1] However, the spike gear it gains after evolving is not actually alive. Klinklang's red core is able to contain an enormous amount of energy, which it uses to launch gears as well as powerful blasts of electricity from its spikes. Klinklang and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Gear Grind. Prior to Generation VII, Shift Gear was also one of its signature moves. Its red core gear can spin at high speeds to rapidly charge itself with energy."
