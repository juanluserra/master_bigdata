    "pokemon": "Bellsprout",
    "pokedex_number": "0069",
    "origin": "Bellsprout may be based on carnivorous pitcher plants, particularly those of the Nepenthes genus. Its Pokémon Red and Green Pokédex entry suggests it's based on legendary mandrake plant.",
    "description": "Bellsprout is a plant-based Pokémon with a stem-like brown body. There is a single green leaf on each side of its body. It has a yellow bell-shaped head with what appear to be pink lips at the end and beady black eyes. It is capable of spitting corrosive acid from its mouth. Its stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey. Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such. It will plant its roots in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted. Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, thus it lives in temperate forests and jungles. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Bellsprout is known to sleep while planting its roots deep in the ground.[1] Because Bellsprout feels so safe while sleeping, it tends to forget that it may need to run from danger."
