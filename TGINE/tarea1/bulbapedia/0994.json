    "descripcion": "Iron Moth is very similar to Volcarona in appearance, resembling a robotic moth. It has four small \"feet\", red compound eyes, red horns on the sides of its head, and white armor plating covering its thorax. Its abdomen is black and light blue with two black diamond spots on the outside. It has six diamond-shaped wings that are mostly orange with white speckles and a single black triangle marking, which levitate a short distance away from its body. In an article from an August issue of Occulture magazine, it is said that the name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a flying object described in the Violet Book. Iron Moth is said to resemble Volcarona, and it would descend from the skies, following people around and occasionally attacking them. Some point to Iron Moth's aggression as evidence supporting that it may be a UFO controlled by alien life. It is speculated that something out there may be using Iron Moth to observe the people of the Pokémon world in preparation for an invasion. In the TCG, it was shown to be capable of sending its \"legs\" flying by themselves independently of its body. It has been seen releasing attacks from its six connected wings similarly to a cannon. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its wings to its back and causing the orange energy on its wings to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Moth is a future Pokémon related to Volcarona. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Moth is a counterpart of Volcarona from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Moth were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Iron Moth and its present day relative Volcarona, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fiery Dance."
