    "descripcion": "Froakie is a quadrupedal, frog-like Pokémon. It has light-blue skin, white hands, and a dark blue stripe from the center of its oval head to its nose. It has three fingers and two toes on its hands and feet. Its eyes, which have yellow sclerae, black irises, and white pupils, protrude vertically from its head due to their size. Froakie produces a large mane of bubbles from its chest and back and has two small bubbles on its nose. The delicate yet flexible bubbles, called Frubbles (Japanese: ケロムース Keromousse), reduce the damage Froakie takes from attacks. Despite its carefree attitude, it is vigilant of its surroundings. Froakie uses a happy-go-lucky look as an act to trick its enemies. It will suddenly drop the facade without warning and overwhelm its foes with its blinding speed. Froakie is both light and strong, making it capable of jumping incredibly high.[1] Upon jumping high, it will throw springy bubbles at the heads of foes. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
