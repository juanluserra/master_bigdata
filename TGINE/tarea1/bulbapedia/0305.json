    "descripcion": "Lairon is a stocky, armored Pokémon with four short legs. Its body is dark gray, and its eyes are sky blue. Its back is covered with segments of iron armor, each with a high ridge and round dark holes on the sides. The sides of its lower jaw have several flat protrusions, and two teeth are visible in its mouth. There are two-pronged metal bands on its legs. The upper band is gray and the lower is silver. Lairon smashes its steely body against others when battling over territory, and shows off its strength with the size of sparks it creates by ramming into rocks. Close inspection of Lairon has revealed scratches and dents left on the armor from its conflicts. It drinks nutritious mineral spring water and feeds on iron contained in rocks. However it has gotten into conflict with humans over these territories in the past. It builds its nest on mountains where iron ore is buried, which results in it clashing with humans that are iron mining or other Lairon. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Lairon sometimes falls asleep while eating iron ore. The reason is due to Lairon having strong desire to win in future territorial disputes."
