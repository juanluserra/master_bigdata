    "descripcion": "Marowak is a bipedal Pokémon with light brown skin and a cream-colored underside. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot makes up its toes. It has a short tail with a small spike near the tip. Marowak's head is composed of the skull it once wore as a mask. It can no longer remove the skull, which has become part of its body. The skull has two pointed spikes on the back similar to ears and tiny nostrils on the tip of the snout. Marowak's triangular, brown eyes are also located in the skull. Marowak is well known for its ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as sturdy as armor. Upon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz, which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.[1] On occasion, it is seen affectionately holding onto the bone while sleeping. Marowak and its pre-evolved form, Cubone, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak and Cubone are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III, Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves."
