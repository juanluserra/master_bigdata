    "descripcion": "Serperior is a primarily pale green, serpentine Pok√©mon. Its face and throat are white, while its back is dark green. Curled, mint-colored patterns extend into the white portion of its face, and it has narrow red eyes. In the lower jaw, two fangs are visible when its mouth is open. There are two pointed yellow extensions on the back of its head. Coiled, dark green extensions spread out from the sides of its lower neck, forming a curving pattern lower down the body. It has now completely lost the legs from its previous stages and now must slither about due to its new, serpentine form; however, just below its neck, it has two small leaf-like arms on either side of its body, which it usually keeps folded behind its back. It has curved yellow markings around its middle and several palmate leaves on its tail. Serperior will only attack with full force against opponents that are unfazed by its piercing glare, which is said to be able to halt its foes' movements. This intimidating stare and its regal form have earned it the title of \"Lord of the Forest\". It is capable of amplifying solar energy with its body."
