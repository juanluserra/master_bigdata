    "pokemon": "Miraidon",
    "pokedex_number": "1008",
    "origin": "Miraidon's appearance may be based on a robotic serpentine dragon and various lizards, such as the anole or the genera Sitana and Sarada — the latter two are collectively known as fan-throated lizards. Its  robotic look might also be a reference to how futuristic cultures are often depicted with the overuse of machines and robots, as opposed to Koraidon's traditional look. Some elements of its design may be based on parts of various motorized vehicles (such as a sport bike and other super bikes designed with maneuverability in mind for city streets and highways), with its casque resembling a motorcycle windshield, its shoulders being similar to handlebars, its rear looking like the backrest of a vehicle seat, its throat and tail resembling wheels when active, and its legs resembling jet engines or exhaust pipes. Miraidon's ability to rearrange itself when changing between forms may be inspired by transforming robots. Miraidon's color scheme, along with the name of the game it debuts in, possibly stemmed from violet being on the opposite side of the visible spectrum of light from red (a prominent color associated with Pokémon Scarlet and Koraidon) as well as violet occasionally being associated with space (which is often considered the \"final frontier\", tying to Miraidon's hypothetical future motifs).",
    "description": "Miraidon is a large, robotic, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily metallic, violet body. Its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, while its claws are white. A distinctive feature of Miraidon is the gular sac on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple casque reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. Miraidon's eyes resemble an LED display, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. Miraidon's shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, fender-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of Miraidon's feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling tire treads. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Miraidon is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac. Despite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. Miraidon's calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. Miraidon also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically Herba Mystica sandwiches, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Miraidon can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the advanced engine within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by Electric Terrain. In battle, Miraidon can also race at ultrafast speeds to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with Cyclizar, a contemporary Pokémon, though Miraidon is notably more powerful and aggressive. The origins of Miraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Turo, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. According to AI Turo, it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was referred to as the \"Iron Serpent\" in the Violet Book, with its current name, Miraidon, attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a bootstrap paradox. Miraidon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electro Drift. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Hadron Engine as an Ability."
