    "pokedex_number": "0712",
    "origin": "Bergmite appears to be based on an iceberg or a stalagmite. Bergmite may represent the tip of the iceberg, which is small compared to the submerged part. Its behavior of attaching itself in groups to Avalugg during the day may reference phoresis in mites.",
    "description": "Bergmite is a quadrupedal Pokémon with a white, round body and nubby legs. Its upper half is encased in a slightly transparent, pale blue chunk of ice. Its eyes, which are yellow with purple rings surrounding them, are visible through the ice. The ice itself forms a large triangle with smaller spikes on its forehead and hind end. Despite its chunky appearance, it is capable of swimming. Bergmite can create cold air, which is used to repair cracks in its icy coating. This air reaches temperatures as cold as −150 degrees Fahrenheit (−100 degrees Celsius) and can be used to freeze enemies. Bergmite lives in herds on snowy mountain tops and can sometimes be found huddled on the back of an Avalugg, freezing itself in place as the Avalugg carries it to new habitats. Bergmite quarrels with Frigibax whenever they encounter each other."
