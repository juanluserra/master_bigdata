    "descripcion": "Gothita is a small, humanoid Pok√©mon. A small tuft of hair sticks up from the top of its purple head, and it has two white, bow-shaped feelers on each side of the head and a third bow-shaped feeler on its neck. These ribbon-like feelers are used to amplify Gothita's psychic power, and will cause Gothita to cry if touched. It has two large blue eyes with three eyelashes on each and small red lips. Its torso is black with a white zigzagging line running horizontally through the middle. Its arms and legs are short and stubby with no visible digits. Gothita intently observes those around it, looking at something only it can see. It can become so focused that it ends up being unaware of attacks. Gothita are normally known to be innocent. It is usually quiet, but sometimes it makes muted cries, even when alone. This is believed to be Gothita communicating with invisible beings."
