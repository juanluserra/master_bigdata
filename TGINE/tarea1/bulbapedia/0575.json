    "descripcion": "Gothorita is a black, humanoid Pokémon with slim arms and legs. There are two round black buns on each side of its head, with a smaller drop-shaped piece hanging from each. Adorning its hair are two pairs of white bows on each bun. It has a pale purple face with cyan eyes and red lips. It has two white bows on its body, which flares at the bottom to form a skirt shape. Gothorita uses starlight as the source of its power, and is able to use its psychic powers to arrange rocks into the shapes of constellations. It can also use these powers to control people and Pokémon with hypnosis, leading people astray and putting children to sleep before kidnapping them. Because of this, Gothorita is known as the Witch of Punishment. Some people believe Gothorita is from outer space, although this connection is yet to be confirmed."
