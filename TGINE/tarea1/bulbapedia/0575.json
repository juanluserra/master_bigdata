    "pokemon": "Gothorita",
    "pokedex_number": "0575",
    "origin": "Gothorita is based on a young girl dressed in Gothic lolita fashion and the common trope to associate goth girls with magical powers or witches. The Gothic lolita fashion itself is highly influenced by the fashion from the Victorian period of the United Kingdom and also by styles from the Rococo period, the Rococo being an artistic movement born in the 18th century in France, that later spreaded to other parts of Europe and the colonial Americas.\nConsidering its connection to stars, Gothorita's body shape also slightly resembles the common depiction of the astrological sign Libra, or as a feminine Pokémon it may also represent Virgo, like it does in Horoscope in Unova.",
    "description": "Gothorita is a black, humanoid Pokémon with slim arms and legs. There are two round black buns on each side of its head, with a smaller drop-shaped piece hanging from each. Adorning its hair are two pairs of white bows on each bun. It has a pale purple face with cyan eyes and red lips. It has two white bows on its body, which flares at the bottom to form a skirt shape. Gothorita uses starlight as the source of its power, and is able to use its psychic powers to arrange rocks into the shapes of constellations. It can also use these powers to control people and Pokémon with hypnosis, leading people astray and putting children to sleep before kidnapping them. Because of this, Gothorita is known as the Witch of Punishment. Some people believe Gothorita is from outer space, although this connection is yet to be confirmed."
