    "descripcion": "Flutter Mane is a dark bluish-green, ghost-like Pokémon. While it has no visible arms or legs, its lower half has several small appendages that resemble a ruffled dress, and its hair resembles a set of arms with feathers. It has several round red gems around its neck and red spikes growing from the top of its head. Its large eyes are yellow with red sclerae. In an article from a May issue of Occulture magazine, it is stated that Flutter Mane's name was taken from a strange creature with a matching description appearing in the Scarlet Book. It is said to float around the sky at night with its long hair writhing about it. According to the magazine, eyewitness accounts initially described it as resembling a giant Misdreavus, albeit a highly fierce and aggressive one, and that some believe it to be a ghost of a pterosaur from a long-gone era. According to AI Sada, Flutter Mane is an ancient Pokémon related to Misdreavus. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Flutter Mane is a counterpart of Misdreavus from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Flutter Mane were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago."
