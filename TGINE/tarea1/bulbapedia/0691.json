    "descripcion": "Dragalge is an aquatic Pokémon that resembles a common sea dragon. Its body is curved in a way that vaguely resembles the number three. Its sides are a light purple with slender vertical lines, while most of the rest of its body is a dull brown. There is a light purple patch on its face surrounding its red eyes. It has a tubular, upturned snout and on the back of its head is a thin appendage. On top of its head is a red, leaf-like crest with two brownish-green antennae. On either side of its body is a skinny, leaf-like appendage and its tailfin also resembles a large leaf. There are three small spikes along its back. Dragalge is a territorial Pokémon that will spit poison at whatever trespasses on its territory. Its poison is strong enough to melt the hulls of metal tankers. As a result, it is said that ships sailing through the seas where it lives never return. It hunts by hiding itself in seaweed and then ambushing prey, such as Finizen, with a spray of poisonous liquid. However, it is known to coexist well with Dhelmise. Dragalge can create Dragon energy by absorbing the sunlight through the plume on its head."
