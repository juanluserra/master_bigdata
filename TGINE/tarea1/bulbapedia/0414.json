    "pokemon": "Mothim",
    "pokedex_number": "0414",
    "origin": "While Mothim represents the adult stage of a bagworm moth, which only fully matures if it is male, both its appearance and honey-thieving tendencies suggest that it may draw more inspiration from the lesser death's head hawkmoth, also known as the bee robber. Its \"tail\" is reminiscent of the flared abdomen of various sphingids, such as the bee hawk-moths. Its silhouette is similar to that of a hawk in flight, possibly playing on the term \"hawk moth.\"",
    "description": "Mothim is a moth-like Pokémon with two pairs of wings, one pair larger than the other is. The wings are primarily tan with an orange, oval marking on each. The tips of the wings split into small, orange squares; there are three on the larger pair and two on the smaller pair. Mothim spreads steel-colored scales whenever it flaps its wings. Mothim's head has orange semi-circular eyes with gray, orange-tipped antennae running along the edges before extending and widening at the top. Its body is black with a patch of orange on the underside and a gray stripe down its back. It also has four gray legs and a small black tail that splits into two squares. Mothim is a nomadic, nocturnal Pokémon that always remains on the move, searching for flower honey and nectar. It has often been seen traveling in fields and mountains. Despite its diet, Mothim is never seen near any flower gardens. This is because, instead of gathering honey on its own, Mothim raids the hives of Combee for honey. It is a male-only species, with Wormadam as its female counterpart."
