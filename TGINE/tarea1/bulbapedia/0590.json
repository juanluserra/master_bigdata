    "descripcion": "Foongus is a white, mushroom-like Pokémon with a cap that looks quite similar to a Poké Ball. It has stubby, digit-less arms, a tiny mouth with large pink lips, and pinprick-like dark eyes. A theory suggests that the developer of modern Poké Balls actually modeled it after Foongus's cap due to liking the Pokémon, although this is supposition. Foongus uses its Poké Ball-like pattern to lure people and Pokémon in grassy areas, before releasing a cloud of poisonous spores to defend itself. The spores can be used as a stomach medicine if thoroughly dried. Foongus moves by either hopping or turning on its side and rolling on its cap. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon. It prefers damp places, such as around trees."
