    "descripcion": "Aron is a quadrupedal Pokémon with four stubby legs and a large round head. Its body is black with plates of gray steel armor covering its head, back, and legs. Throughout its body are small openings in the armor. There are six openings on its head, with the largest two being openings for its pale blue eyes and one opening on either side of the spike on its back. A single, blunt spike protrudes from its back. Aron feeds on iron ore that it digs from mountains. It uses this ore to make its body. Sometimes, hunger will drive it to descend from the mountains to eat bridges and rails, which makes it a pest. It makes a new suit of armor after evolving, while its old discarded armor is salvaged for making iron products. People have been collecting Aron's shed armor since ancient times. With one all-out charge, it can demolish even a heavy dump truck. It lives on mountains. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Aron has been observed eating an iron ore snack on rare occasions."
