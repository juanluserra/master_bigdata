    "descripcion": "Poliwag is an amphibian Pokémon resembling a blue, spherical tadpole. It has large eyes and pink lips that can also act as suction cups for rocks. Its skin is very thin, but flexible and difficult to puncture. There is a black and white swirl on its abdomen, which is actually its internal organs showing through its semitransparent skin. The swirl is clearer following a meal and will have a white tinge if the Pokémon is affected by disease. The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it. Poliwag has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light-blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. It loves to waddle on land despite the dangers. However, it will quickly return back into the water should it see danger. It cannot walk on land well unless trained everyday. Because of its ineptitude on land, Poliwag is more likely to be found swimming in small freshwater ponds and lakes. In the Pokémon the Series episode The Stun Spore Detour, Poliwag is shown feeding on salveyo weed, which can only be found on clear lake bottoms."
