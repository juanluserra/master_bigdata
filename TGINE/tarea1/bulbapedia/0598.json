    "descripcion": "Ferrothorn is a Pokémon resembling a flattened durian. Its metallic body is covered in thorns, with three black stripes circling its width. The middle stripe has triangular shapes just below its eyes, which have green rims, yellow sclerae, and dark pupils. There is a green spike at the top of its body, and extending around it are its feelers, which are vine-like, long green appendages tipped with spiky metal disks. Ferrothorn can use these feelers to either cling onto the ceilings of a cave or walk around. Ferrothorn also uses the feelers to absorb nutrients from rocks. It attacks by shooting its spikes, which are harder than steel. Ferrothorn's attacks are strong enough to pulverize boulders. Prior to Generation VII, Ferrothorn and its pre-evolved form, Ferroseed, were the only known Pokémon that could have Iron Barbs as an Ability."
