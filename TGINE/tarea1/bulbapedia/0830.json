    "pokemon": "Eldegoss",
    "pokedex_number": "0830",
    "origin": "Eldegoss resembles the seedpods of the plants from the Anemone genus, like the windflower, which is common in the British Isles. It may also draw inspiration from a full-bloomed ball of cotton and on how it is used to make textile products. In addition, Eldegoss may be based on stereotypical depictions of elderly women. Its fluff may be based on an afro haircut.",
    "description": "Eldegoss is a plant-like Pokémon. It has a light green head, with amber-brownish eyes and light green pupils, as well as green triangular stripes above its eyes. Eldegoss's lower body consists of a yellow upper part that resembles a cloak, and a darker green lower part that resembles a dress. Above its head is a green crest that fills a notch in its head. This crest is filled with a cotton fluff that is larger than Eldegoss's body. There are tiny brown seeds that can be found scattered on the top of the cotton. Eldegoss's cotton fluff acts like a cushion to protect its head from attacks. The cotton can also be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn that is a specialty in Galar. When Eldegoss's cotton is weaved together with Cottonee's cotton, it makes a cloth that is popular with many luxury brands. It is said that the seeds inside Eldegoss's cotton fluff is highly nutritious and beneficial for people and Pokémon. Eldegoss spreads the seeds by wind, enriching the soil with nutrients wherever these seeds land.[1] Eldegoss and its pre-Evolution, Gossifleur, are the only known Pokémon that can have Cotton Down as an Ability."
