    "descripcion": "Heatran is a reddish-brown, quadrupedal Pokémon. It is dotted with orange and gray spots, and it has metal bangles locked on its legs. Its four claws on each of its feet are in a cross formation. Heatran has a gray underside, and its face is covered by an iron mask, with red-orange eyes uncovered. Its eyes seem to remain open even when it is asleep. Whenever it is seen with its mouth open, an orange glow emanates from inside it. Boiling magma-like blood circulates through its body. While its body is rugged steel, certain parts of it are partially melted, due to Heatran's own intense body heat. Heatran is a fierce guardian. Without the power of the Magma Stone, Heatran would rampage and cause the volcanic crater where it dwells to erupt. Heatran's claws allow it to dig deep into walls, and its feet allow it to stick to a surface, so it can hang and climb from walls and ceilings. According to legends, Heatran was said to have been created from the magma hidden beneath Mount Coronet. The body of Heatran is said to hold many unsolved mysteries. Heatran has the ability to form a shield around itself in order to protect itself from harm. Heatran is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Magma Storm."
