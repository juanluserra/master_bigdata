    "pokemon": "Nidoran♂",
    "pokedex_number": "0032",
    "origin": "Nidoran♂ appears to draw inspiration from various characteristics of lagomorphs and rodents, with aspects of venomous mammals. It may also reference the mythical Moon rabbit due to its rabbit like appearance and the fact that it reaches its final evolved form using a Moon Stone. Its differences from Nidoran♀ may be based on sexual dimorphism, and the coloration of Nidoran and its evolutions may be a reference to the gendered associations of pink and blue in previous centuries.",
    "description": "Nidoran♂ is a small, quadrupedal, mammalian Pokémon. It is pinkish purple with darker patches. It has large, spiny ears with teal insides, oversized front teeth, and red eyes. Its back is covered with three lines of large spines that can release potent poisons if threatened. The center line of spines is taller than the other two. The size of the long, pointed horn on its forehead is indicative of the strength of its venom. Nidoran♂ is a male-only species. Nidoran♂ constantly listens for the sounds of approaching enemies with its large ears. Said ears have unique muscles that allow them to be moved in any direction, and even the slightest sound does not escape Nidoran♂'s notice. In order to listen to distant locations, it flaps its ears like wings. When angry, it extends its toxic spikes and charges, stabbing with its horn to inject poison. Nidoran♂ is brave, and will risk its own life to protect Nidoran♀. Nidoran♂ lives in open spaces, such as savannas and plains."
