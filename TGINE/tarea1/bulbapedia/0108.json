    "descripcion": "Lickitung is a bipedal amphibian Pokémon with a round body and a thick, powerful tail. It has soft, pink skin with curved yellow lines on its belly and a yellow ring marking on each knee. It has a thumb-like claw on each hand and a single large nail on each foot. There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled. At over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pokémon), reaching for berries, exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Deceit and Assist. When capturing prey, Lickitung prefers swallowing them whole after paralyzing them with its tongue. Lickitung can be found in grassy plains and meadows."
