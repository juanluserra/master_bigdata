    "descripcion": "Azumarill is a blue, bipedal semiaquatic leporine Pokémon that has an ovoid body. The lower half of its body is white with a white, bubble-like pattern above it, which helps to camouflage it in water. It has elongated, rabbit-like ears with red insides and circular eyes. When in the water, it rolls up its ears to prevent the insides from becoming wet. Its arms and feet are short with rounded ends and no discernible digits. It has a black zigzagging tail with a blue, bubble-like tip. The tip of its tail tends to glow when it attacks or is excited. Azumarill has highly developed hearing that allows it to hear distances, even when it is underwater. By keeping still and listening closely, it can identify prey even in wild, fast-moving rivers. If Azumarill spots a drowning Pokémon, it will make an air bubble that helps them breathe or when Azurill are playing near the rivers. It lives in rivers and lakes and can live in the water all day long. Prior to Generation VI and in Generation IX, Azumarill and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Huge Power as an Ability."
