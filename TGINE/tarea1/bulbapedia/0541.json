    "pokemon": "Swadloon",
    "pokedex_number": "0541",
    "origin": "Swadloon appears to be based on a leaf-rolling insect pupa or prepupa such as a Pamphilius sawfly caterpillar or a lepidopteran prepupa such as a silver-spotted skipper. Many holometabolous insects fold leaves over themselves for camouflage and shelter in their immobile pupal stage, eventually use silk to stick the leaves together and form its chrysalis. It also resembles a walking leaf and the nest of weaver ants. The appearance of Swadloon hiding in its blanket bears some resemblance to the stereotypical portrayal of people suffering from hikikomori (acute social anxiety disorder) syndrome in Japanese media. Its evolution into Leavanny (whose Japanese name is two kana away from \"hikikomori\") being caused by friendship may also be a lesson.",
    "description": "Swadloon is a round, yellow Pokémon with two stubby arms inside of a cloak of leaves. It drapes the leaves over itself and draws them closed around its body, so only a large, crescent slit remains for its face to appear. This leafy cloak keeps the Pokémon warm. Under its cloak are darker green, limp leaves that frame the sides of Swadloon's face and trail down on the sides of its body. The top of the cloak has two semicircular leaves that form a V shape. These two head leaves allow Swadloon to detect air movements and feel the surrounding area. On its back are the veins of the leaf as well as a bit at the bottom tip of the cloak resembling a rounded tail. Swadloon lives on the forest floor and converts fallen leaves into nourishment, which helps the surrounding plant life grow."
