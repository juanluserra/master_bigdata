    "pokemon": "Cradily",
    "pokedex_number": "0346",
    "origin": "Cradily may be based on crinoids (also known as sea lilies), extant marine animals. Crinoid fossils are particularly abundant, possibly inspiring Cradily's status as a fossil Pokémon. Its tentacles may be based on those of the sea anemone. It also bears resemblance to the predatory tunicate. Cradily's fake eyes are a type of animal mimicry. Cradily's English and Japanese names along with the placement of its tentacles indicate that it is possibly inspired by a baby mobile.",
    "description": "Cradily is a green, plantlike Pokémon based on a Crinoid with various yellow markings on its head, neck, and torso. There are circular, yellow eyespots on its head. However, its true eyes are concealed inside the dark, crescent opening on its head. Surrounding its head at the base are eight pink tentacles, which somewhat resemble flower petals. Its long, flexible neck has yellow bands in the center, and it can be extended to assist in capturing prey. Its body is short and squat with four stubby growths and a yellow, oval, target-like pattern on the chest. Cradily's heavy body acts as an anchor, preventing it from getting washed away by rough ocean currents. In ancient times, it built its nest in the shallows of warm seas. When the tide went out, it came up on land to search for prey. However, Cradily cannot move very fast due to its short legs. Instead, Cradily can extend its neck and tentacles by three times its usual length.  It then uses its tentacles to capture them and melts them with strong digestive acidic fluid secreted by the tentacles."
