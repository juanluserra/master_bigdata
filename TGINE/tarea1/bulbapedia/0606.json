    "descripcion": "Beheeyem is a brown extraterrestrial Pokémon with an oblong head that features depressions on both sides. It has black, symmetrical lines going down the front of its head. Under the rim of its head, there lay two green eyes with small black pupils. It has a lighter brown \"collar\" and four dots on its chest of the same color. Beheeyem's arms have three finger-like digits: one red, one green, and one yellow. It has a rim underneath its main body, under which are two small legs. Beheeyem communicates by flashing its multi-colored fingers in patterns; these patterns have yet to be decoded. Beheeyem can manipulate the memories of its opponents, being able to erase or even rewrite them. Beheeyem is believed to be responsible for the mysterious disappearances of Dubwool whenever it visits a farm. It is sometimes found hovering over wheat fields. In the Pokémon the Series episode Capacia Island UFO!, Beheeyem is shown to be capable of building and controlling spaceships. Said spaceships are powered up by koban/Amulet Coin. When humans and Pokémon fall under its hypnosis, they will wear Beheeyem shaped masks. Beheeyem can used those under its control to speak to humans. However, this hypnotic power cannot work on beings who are not very smart."
