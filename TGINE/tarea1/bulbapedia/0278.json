    "descripcion": "Wingull is a small, white Pokémon similar in appearance to a seagull. Its head makes up a large portion of its body, and it appears to lack a neck. Wingull has thin, simplistic eyes, two triangular tufts on top of its head, and an orange beak with a hooked, black tip. Three blue-tipped feathers give it a fan-like tail and its small, orange feet have two webbed toes. Wingull has long, flat wings with light blue stripes near the tips. Wingull has hollow bones, which makes it light enough to fly. By extending its wings, it can catch updrafts and glide across the sky. Wingull folds its wings only when it is resting. It builds its nests on steep cliffs by the sea, and habitually hides prey and valuables in various locations using its beak, especially during winter season. Wingull's main predators are Talonflame, which attacks and catches them with powerful kicks; and Barraskewda, which leaps out and bites any Wingull flying too close to the water's surface. It circles above oceans looking for its favorite food, Wishiwashi, to eat. It also loves to eat Finneon who jump up on the sea surface. Fishermen use Wingull's skill to locate areas teeming with fish Pokémon."
