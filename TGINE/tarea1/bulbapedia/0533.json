    "pokemon": "Gurdurr",
    "pokedex_number": "0533",
    "origin": "Timburr's Pokédex entry supports that it and its evolved forms are based on construction workers. Gurdurr in particular is always holding a steel beam. Its body appears to be covered with swollen veins from physical labor. Due to its clown nose, clown hair-like structure on its head, and buff body, Gurdurr may have also been based on a muscleman carny from a carnival sideshow. A red nose is also often used commonly in anime for old gruff men.",
    "description": "Gurdurr is a gray bipedal Pokémon with a large, round dark-red nose. It has bulbous features, resembling curls of \"hair\", on its head. Violet bulges resembling swelling veins pattern its muscular, large arms, thighs, and chest, and similar thick violet bands adorn its shoulders. It possesses an hourglass shape. It is known to usually carry an I-beam girder in its arms. The steel frame is used to train its muscles, and Gurdurr boasts about its muscles with Machoke and other members of its kind. However, if the individual fails to measure up to the others, it will proceed to lay low for some time. It is so strong that it won't even be moved if it is attacked by a group of professional wrestlers. It is usually found near construction sites. Unlike Timburr, Gurdurr is not good at helping with construction; rather, it excels at demolition."
