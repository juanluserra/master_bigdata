    "descripcion": "Toxel is a small, quadrupedal, purple, lizard-like baby Pok√©mon. It has a lightning bolt-like protrusion on its forehead, along with four conical spikes surrounding its head. It has violet eyes with black pupils and white sclerae. Toxel typically has its light purple tongue sticking out of its mouth. Its cheeks are marked with a very pale whitish lavender spot on each side. Its chest also has a pale lavender-white spot, heavily resembling a baby's bib. Its lower half is light purple with lines running down the sides, resembling a diaper and entirely covering its short, tapering tail. Its arms and legs have two stubby fingers and toes each, with pale white spots under the toes and palms. Toxel also has two white spots on its back, just below its head. Toxel has two sacs inside its body, one to store poison and one to store electricity. It is able to drink dirty water and filter it into a poison that is harmless to it. By manipulating the chemical makeup of this poison, it can produce electricity. Toxel relays the electric poison through its skin. While the voltage produced by this electrified poison is weak, it can cause a tingling paralysis if touched. Toxel has a selfish nature and loves seeking attention."
