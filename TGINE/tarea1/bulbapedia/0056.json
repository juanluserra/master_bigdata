    "descripcion": "Mankey is a small, simian Pokémon, similar to a New World monkey. It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is rare to find a Mankey sleeping without an angry look on its face.[1]"
