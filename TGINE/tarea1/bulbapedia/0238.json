    "pokemon": "Smoochum",
    "pokedex_number": "0238",
    "origin": "Smoochum may be based on ギャル gyaru, blonde-haired, tanned Japanese girls, but is meant to resemble an otherwise normal human child. One type of gyaru, the gyaru-mama, will raise their children with the gyaru fashion style, usually in their image. This concept is more visibly seen in its design from the Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo, where Smoochum more clearly takes after Jynx. Additionally, Yuki-onna, a possible origin for Jynx, is sometimes shown as holding a seemingly human child. Smoochum could also be based on the legend of Kintarō, a human child raised by the Yama-uba, another possible origin of Jynx.",
    "description": "Smoochum is a small, humanoid Pokémon that resembles a baby. It has a large head with blonde hair that reaches its shoulders and has large bangs. There are several tufts of hair sticking up on top of its head. Its skin is light purple with a cream-colored chest, arms, and feet. It has large, blue-green eyes and a pair of large, pink lips. These lips are sensitive enough that Smoochum uses them to identify and examine objects that it sees for the first time, and are kept moist by its daily application of tree sap. This help Smoochum determine if it likes the object or not. When walking, Smoochum rocks its head back and forth. Smoochum is known to be very curious. This Pokémon is very active and runs about, although it often falls. Being very conscious of its appearance, it will check its reflection when given the chance to make sure it is not dirty. It will bathe the instant it finds any dirt on its face. However, it doesn't mind if its body get dirty. Smoochum is found living in cities and cold caverns. Smoochum is a female-only species, with no male counterpart."
