    "descripcion": "Hattrem is a small, vaguely humanoid Pok√©mon with a pink body and a large, light blue mass of hair surrounding its head. It has a conical point on top of its hair that is pink at the bottom and white at the top, with the tip being crooked and tapering off at the end. This gives the hair the appearance of a witch's hat. On the sides of its hair are two large, blue bulbous growths that appears to be held by pink rings. These growths resembles ponytails and Hattrem uses them to stand on. Hattrem has two, thin arms lacking any digits, and a white ovular spot on its chest. Its waist extends out into two lumps, with very small, light blue joint-less and digit-less legs. Its eyes have black sclerae and white pupils, with two pink dots for highlights that make its pupils vaguely resemble cartoon hearts. Hattrem makes use of its ponytails as hands, pummeling its foes with them. One blow from these ponytails would knock out a professional boxer. Hattrem perceives strong emotions, including positive ones, as if they're really loud noises. Thus, Hattrem will violently silence anything nearby expressing or feeling strong emotions."
