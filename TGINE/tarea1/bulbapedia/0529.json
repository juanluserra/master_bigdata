    "descripcion": "Drilbur is a mole-like Pokémon that has a short, wide body with two small, ovoid feet with three toes each. Its body is mostly black, but has a jagged, navy blue stripe that runs diagonally around its torso from its left shoulder. It is connected at the bottom to another stripe, which extends around the base of its torso. It has a white face with a long snout, tipped by its pink nose. Its eyes are at the base of its nose on either side. Drilbur's arms are wide and thin with a blue spot on its palms. It lacks traditional hands, as its arms form directly into its three, extremely large claws. It has a very small, stubby tail. Drilbur can straighten its body and align its claws forward, allowing it to spin like a drill and dig through the ground. It can dig at speeds of up to 30 mph (50 km/h). A Drilbur is fast enough to make a running car race with it. As seen in the 481st chapter of Pokémon Adventures and the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode A Village Homecoming!, Drilbur has no issues being around humans and can be very friendly. However, many farmers dislike Drilbur because it tends to destroy their vegetable crops."
