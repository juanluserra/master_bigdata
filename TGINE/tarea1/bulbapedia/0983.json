    "descripcion": "Kingambit is a humanoid Pokémon whose appearance resembles a samurai. Its body is mostly red and black, with gold accents on its torso and helmet-like head. The blade on its head has grown tremendously from its time as a Bisharp, extending upward into a large machete shape with a sword-shaped indentation on it. It also has a large mustache composed of two black, red-lined blades, and two bright red circles on either side of its front torso. From its waist protrude two pairs of curved blades, somewhat resembling the omega (Ω) symbol. These curved blades surround Kingambit's body and its golden, ridged forearms. Additionally, Kingambit has long, curved, metallic black hair that completely shields its back, and is sturdy enough for it to sit on as well as ride upon. Kingambit can additionally form its prehensile hair into spikes to strike its foes with. As seen in HZ058, Kingambit can float and hover above the ground to move about. Commanding many colonies of Pawniard and Bisharp as its personal army, Kingambit is a powerful force in battle. It has a battle-hungry disposition, and will not stop until it gets what it desires.[1] However, it is not strategically adept, so it typically seeks to win its battles through brute force with sheer numbers. It is said that only the strongest Bisharp can evolve into Kingambit. Kingambit is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Kowtow Cleave. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Supreme Overlord as an Ability."
