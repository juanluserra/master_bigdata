    "descripcion": "Flabébé is a small Pokémon with a white upper half and a green lower half. It has beady eyes, a pink blush mark on each cheek, long, notched ears, and a small, pointed nose. On top of its head are several spheres of pollen that form a crown. It has stubby arms and a tail, but no visible legs. Flabébé is a female-only species with no male counterpart. It is one of the shortest and lightest Pokémon in existence. Flabébé is usually seen holding the yellow stigma of a flower, called a \"Fairy Flower\" in the Pokémon the Series: XY episode To Find a Fairy Flower!. The flower has three stamens and rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. It also has a short green stem with three small leaves. Its crown is made from the flower's pollen, which has healing properties. Flabébé can control and draw power out of the flower but is unsafe without it. However, it will continue searching until it finds a flower that it likes. Once it does, Flabébé will spend the rest of its life taking care of that flower.[1] The Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Under Color of Darkness! showed that if one of the petals on a Flabébé's flower falls off, it will be unable to float around. Prior to Generation VII, Flabébé and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities."
