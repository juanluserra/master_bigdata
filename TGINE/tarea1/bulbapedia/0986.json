    "pokemon": "Brute Bonnet",
    "pokedex_number": "0986",
    "origin": "Brute Bonnet is based on Amoonguss and a dinosaur. It may also be inspired by Syzygites megalocarpus, a parasitic mold that infects mushrooms. It being described as a cross between dinosaur and mushroom may be based on the FIMS (Fungal Infection Mammalian Selection) hypothesis, which considers that fungi contributed to the extinction of dinosaurs. According to the FIMS hypothesis, most of the flora dying out in the events of the K-Pg extinction led to a massive fungal bloom, provoking infections that dinosaurs and other reptiles would be less resistant to than mammals.",
    "description": "Brute Bonnet is a mushroom-like Pokémon with large caps on its head and arms that resemble modern Poké Balls (despite being from the ancient past), pink lips with a jagged appearance, four stumpy brownish legs, and a tail; the cap on its head is spiked and has what seems to be green moss growing underneath it. In an article from a June issue of Occulture magazine, it is described as a bizarre creature combining traits of dinosaurs with those of Amoonguss. It's named after a fierce mushroom creature of matching description that appears in the Scarlet Book. Its gigantic stature and seemingly low intelligence combine to make it a powerful and savage fighter. According to AI Sada, Brute Bonnet is an ancient Pokémon related to Amoonguss. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Brute Bonnet is a counterpart of Amoonguss from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Brute Bonnet were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago."
