    "descripcion": "Brute Bonnet is a mushroom-like Pokémon with large caps on its head and arms that resemble modern Poké Balls (despite being from the ancient past), pink lips with a jagged appearance, four stumpy brownish legs, and a tail; the cap on its head is spiked and has what seems to be green moss growing underneath it. In an article from a June issue of Occulture magazine, it is described as a bizarre creature combining traits of dinosaurs with those of Amoonguss. It's named after a fierce mushroom creature of matching description that appears in the Scarlet Book. Its gigantic stature and seemingly low intelligence combine to make it a powerful and savage fighter. According to AI Sada, Brute Bonnet is an ancient Pokémon related to Amoonguss. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Brute Bonnet is a counterpart of Amoonguss from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Brute Bonnet were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago."
