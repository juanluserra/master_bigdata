    "pokemon": "Grovyle",
    "pokedex_number": "0253",
    "origin": "Appearance-wise, Grovyle resembles the dinosaur known as the Dromaeosaurus. It is believed that the dinosaur had feathers, much like how Grovyle has leaves on its body - the leaves on its tail are especially similar to the tails of Epidexipteryx, which only had short tails that supported much larger feathers. Its design could be based on a Protarchaeopteryx. Like the other members of its evolutionary line, Grovyle's design shares some similarities with the leaf-tailed gecko, a species of lizard that blends in with plantlike appendages. Its green skin and red underside seem to take inspiration from male green anoles, whose dewlaps inflate and turn red to show dominance.",
    "description": "Grovyle is a bipedal Pok√©mon similar in appearance to a theropod dinosaur. It is primarily green with a red underside. There is a belt-like green stripe across its belly. Grovyle's hands have two clawed fingers and powerful legs with birdlike feet. Its well-developed muscles make it an expert climber and allow it to leap quickly from branch to branch. Grovyle has three long leaves on its wrists, a large leaf on top of its head, and two tails that have a leafy appearance. This leafy appearance allows it to be camouflaged in the forests where it lives. In Generation III, Leaf Blade was its signature move."
