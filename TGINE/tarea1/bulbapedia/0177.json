    "pokemon": "Natu",
    "pokedex_number": "0177",
    "origin": "Natu appears to be based on a quetzal, a bird family native to North America. It could also be based on other colorful birds like parrot, possibly the kakapo. It also resembles a quail.",
    "description": "Natu is a tiny, mostly green avian Pokémon with a nearly spherical body colored in accents of red, yellow, and black. It possesses brightly colored, yellow-and-red wings with thick black stripes. The wings are small and not fully-grown, thus making it unable to fly. However, it can hop and climb tree trunks. Natu has a red crest on the top of its head, and its three-toed feet and three tail feathers are red as well. Natu also has almond-shaped eyes and a yellow beak. Natu can be found near ruins and in temperate and tropical forests. Natu usually forages for food on the ground. However, on rare occasions, it will hop onto branches to peck at the tree's new shoots. It also picks food from cactus plants, easily avoiding the buds and spines. Due to its prophetic abilities, Natu is a very cautious Pokémon that is easily spooked. It has the quirky behavior of staring at something until the thing moves."
