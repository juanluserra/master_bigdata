    "pokemon": "Lumineon",
    "pokedex_number": "0457",
    "origin": "Lumineon seems to be based on a freshwater butterflyfish, but it also possesses wings based on actual butterflies, something the butterflyfish does not. In its Platinum Pokédex entry, it is said to walk on the seafloor using its fins, similar to a deepsea tripod fish. It exhibits bioluminescence according to its Diamond, HeartGold, and SoulSilver Pokédex entries, suggesting a possible inspiration in fish that have this ability, such as the marine hatchetfish. Its iridescent appearance and long fins also share some resemblance to a Siamese fighting fish. Its name suggests it may be based on the neon tetra.",
    "description": "Lumineon is a fishlike Pokémon with dark blue scales. Its eyes are deep pink, and its face and eyelids are light blue. It has two pairs of large pectoral fins that resemble butterfly wings. These fins have wavy, light blue markings around the edges, and the lower pair is longer on the female. The light blue markings on Lumineon's pectoral fins are able to emit light. There is a band of light blue running vertically around its body. Its tail is long with a deep pink spot at the tip, and it has a pair of light blue pelvic fins. Lumineon are known to travel in schools, and although it can be found near the water's surface, it usually makes its home deep in the ocean, where it walks along the seafloor using the fins on its chest. This behavior helps it to avoid predators. Lumineon attracts its prey by flashing the patterning on its wing-like fins, although this behavior also attracts ferocious fish Pokémon that Lumineon itself is prey to. It typically competes with Lanturn for food, such as Staryu and Starmie."
