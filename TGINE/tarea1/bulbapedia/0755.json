    "descripcion": "Morelull is a small, white Pokémon similar to a mushroom. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon. It has large, black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides. Small bumps ring the top of its head, similar to hair. Its head is much larger than its thin, stem-like body. At the base, the stem splits into three green roots that act as feet. Three large mushrooms sprout from the center of its head. Each mushroom has a thin white stem and a darker ring of color around the base of the cap. The center and largest mushroom is light pink, while the other two mushrooms are smaller and a light purplish-blue. At night, Morelull can make the spores filling its mushroom caps glow. Morelull likes dark, damp areas such as dense jungles, but changes locations every night to avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other Morelull.[1] When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster.[2]. The caps on Morelull's head are a delicacy for Pokémon living in the forests and can grow back overnight. In Generation VII, Strength Sap was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
