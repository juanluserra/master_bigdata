    "pokemon": "Whismur",
    "pokedex_number": "0293",
    "origin": "Whismur seems to be based on a rabbit or a stuffed animal due to its small size and large ears. Its ears resemble earmuffs, which are used to protect against loud noises. Its tendency to cry loudly when disturbed may be based on the behavior of an infant. It may also be based on an electronic amplifier since its tail resembles an input/output port. The curved yellow marking on its back resembles a stylized sound wave on a volume icon.",
    "description": "Whismur is a mauve, bipedal Pok√©mon with a spherical body. Its eyes are black and shaped like plus signs, and it has a simple, wide mouth. Two small openings on top of its head act as its ear canals. Covering its ear canals are long, yellow-tipped flaps resembling rabbit ears. It has stubby arms and yellow-tipped feet that lack toes and have plus-shaped markings underneath. Above its small, plug-like tail is a yellow, crescent marking. There is a hole in the center of its tail. Whismur are a timid species, being easily frightened by loud noises. Whismur's murmurs are barely audible, but when it senses danger, it lets out an ear-splitting cry as loud as a jet plane taking off. The cry of a Whismur is about 100 decibels and can cause an all-day headache should anyone be near it. Startled by its own cries, it will cry louder. When it finally stops crying, it will fall asleep from exhaustion. Because it breathes through its ear canals, it can cry continually. However, it will stop crying if its ear covers are shut. Whismur lives in caves."
