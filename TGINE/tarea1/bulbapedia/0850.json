    "descripcion": "Sizzlipede is an insectoid Pok√©mon with a long, flat body. Its thorax and head are mainly red-orange with dark brown sections across its body and yellow rings on its underside which can get very hot. Two fiery whiskers protrude from its face, and it uses its short stubby legs to move around. Sizzlipede uses its coils to wrap around the prey before using its heated body to cook it. Sizzlipede, much like its evolved form Centiskorch, can generate heat using the flammable gas stored within its body. Once the prey is cooked to well-done, it will voraciously nibble at them piece by piece until the last morsel. Sizzlipede is related to Skorupi, with the two sharing a common ancestor. It is a similar species to Venipede, but often gets into fights with it whenever the two meet."
