    "descripcion": "Iron Bundle is a red Pokémon resembling a robotic bird. Its face is covered in white plating with two three-pointed crests above its blue eyes. Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single blue spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each. A metallic ring is visible around its neck (which hides a wire allowing it to extend its head over long distances), and its \"bag\" is attached to its body by a black and blue cable. When running, it uses its feet as if it was skiing. There are only two reported sightings of Iron Bundle. According to an article from an October issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Bundle was described in the Violet Book as a being that resembled Delibird possessing a spherical apparatus from which it would fire huge blasts of ice to propel itself through snowy lands. An unproven theory suggests it is the product of a long-gone civilization, as supported by ancient writings that describe the design and usage of machines resembling the Iron Bundle. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the blue energy on the spot on its belly and \"bag\" to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Bundle is a future Pokémon related to Delibird. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Bundle is a counterpart of Delibird from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Bundle were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Delibird and its Paradox Pokémon counterpart, Iron Bundle are the only Pokémon capable of learning the movie Present."
