    "descripcion": "Scatterbug is a black larval Pokémon with a relatively large head. Its head is bisected by a line that runs from the forehead to the mouth. It has large beige eyes with square black pupils, a single pointed tooth that pokes out of its mouth, and three white hairs on top of its head. Scatterbug has a three-segmented body with a pair of nubby, beige legs on each segment. A white ruff of fur encircles its neck, and there is a large beige spot on its rear. Scatterbug eats various types of plants, including poisonous leaves and roots. The poison it ingests is processed and turned into a black powder that it scatters all over its body. This powder causes paralysis on contact, and allows Scatterbug to deter bird Pokémon from attacking. The powder also regulates Scatterbug's temperature, allowing it to adapt to any climate. Grafaiai is a natural predator of Scatterbug.[1]"
