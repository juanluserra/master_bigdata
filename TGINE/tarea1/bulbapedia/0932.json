    "pokemon": "Nacli",
    "pokedex_number": "0932",
    "origin": "Nacli is based on a rock salt crystal embedded in a small sedimentary rock.[3] Its body shape resembles mushrooms, particularly those of the Agaricus bisporus variety. Considering that it originated underground, it might also draw inspiration from truffles. Additionally, its mushroom shape may be a reference to mushroom rocks, which are naturally occurring rock formations.",
    "description": "Nacli is a Pokémon composed of rock salt. Its upper body is rugged and brown, with an off-white stripe circling it, while its lower body is a white salt cube with rectangular orange-yellow eyes that can glow red. A white salt cube is embedded on the top half of its body as well. Nacli are born deep within the earth, inside layers of rock salt. Bits of salt are scraped off of Nacli as it travels the ground, although Nacli is able to create and replenish the salt inside its body. The rear corners of Nacli's lower body are rounded as a result of this scraping[1]. As revealed in HZ057, Nacli lived in Paldean lands since ancient times, forming bonds with humans. In the same episode, it is also thought that Nacli used to help humans in warding off evil spirits for hundreds of years. In the past, it was treasured by people who would use its salt; even today, Nacli salt is still used in foods such as ice cream, because it has a gentle flavor. Nacli and its evolutions are the only known Pokémon that can have Purifying Salt as an Ability."
