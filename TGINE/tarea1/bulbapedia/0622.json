    "descripcion": "Golett is a bipedal Pokémon said to have been constructed from clay in the ancient past to protect an ancient and mysterious civilization of people and Pokémon. Its body is primarily covered by two different shades of blue. Its head features two bewitching, yellow eyes and a stub-like cyan-colored crest on top. Two pairs of crisscrossing brown bands extend around its spherical body meeting at a blue square with a yellow swirl in the center. Two large stone-like blocks act as its feet and two more such blocks adorn its \"forearms\"; each arm ends in a dark blue-colored, crude three-fingered hand. Golett is believed to burn energy inside its core in order to move; this energy also emanates light through the holes near Golett's arms and legs. However, this energy has yet to be identified by researchers. Allegedly \"active for thousands of years\", Golett's animating energy is speculated to run out soon. For unclear reasons, Golett have been reported to continually line up boulders."
