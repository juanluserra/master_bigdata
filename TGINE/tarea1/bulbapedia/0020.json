    "descripcion": "Raticate is a large, rodent-like Pokémon. Although it is often depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is primarily tawny-colored with a cream underside. It has narrow black eyes, ears with ragged edges and dark insides, and large incisors that grow constantly. There are three whiskers on each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. Females will have shorter whiskers. If attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Raticate is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process.[1] This Pokémon typically lives in plains and savannas. Prior to Generation IV, Raticate and its pre-evolved form, Rattata, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang."
