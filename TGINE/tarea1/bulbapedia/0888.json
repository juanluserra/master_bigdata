    "descripcion": "In its Hero of Many Battles form, Zacian is a large cyan lupine Pokémon with yellow eyes, a tan underside, a lean frame, a pink tail, and pink braids going down the side of its body. Two pink fringes of fur are present on its back. There are battle scars on its shoulders, hips, back, and forehead, which reveal a tan coloration under the blue fur. Half of its left ear is also missing. It is believed to be either the elder sister or rival of Zamazenta. In the past, Zacian was feared and respected by the people of Galar. 3000 years ago, it worked together with Zamazenta and two young humans to save the region from Eternatus and the Darkest Day it created, defeating the Gigantic Pokémon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zamazenta in the Slumbering Weald. Zacian can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of Dynamaxing, Zacian may still go berserk when bombarded by Galar particles. As years passed, both Zacian and Zamazenta were forgotten by history, however, Professor Sonia proved their existence by writing her first book: \"Galar: A History\", which details the discovery she and the player had in Stow-on-Side. Zacian is the only known Pokémon that can have Intrepid Sword as its Ability."
