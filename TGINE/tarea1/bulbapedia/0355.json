    "pokemon": "Duskull",
    "pokedex_number": "0355",
    "origin": "Duskull may be based on the Grim Reaper or the bogeyman. The Japanese equivalent of the bogeyman is called the Namahage. Its shape is similar to a Hitodama, the Japanese representation of a human soul. Duskull could also take an inspiration from animated skeletons due to its skull mask and bone markings on its back.",
    "description": "Duskull is a Pokémon which appears to be a stylized personification of the Grim Reaper. Its body resembles a black robe with two bone-shaped patterns on its back. It has a mask that resembles a skull and a single eye that floats between its eye sockets. Duskull can become invisible, sneaking up on their prey and going through walls. Duskull is primarily a nocturnal Pokémon and has been shown to live in thick forests. Once Duskull chooses a target, it will doggedly pursue the intended victim until the break of dawn. It has been described as enjoying the crying of children, and it is said that this Pokémon will spirit away disobedient children. This is often told to children to make them behave. Duskulls's diet consists of the vital energy of children. All victims of Duskull tend to suffer an intense chill after being drained of their life force."
