    "descripcion": "Thievul is an orange-maroon vulpine Pokémon with a moderate build, slender limbs, and a long tail. It has white chest fur that puffs out from its body and vaguely resembles a cravat. There are two long black ears atop Thievul's head, as well as black fur around its eyes that resemble a domino mask. The black whiskers on the end of its muzzle are in the form of a pointed mustache and the white markings above its eyes resemble eyebrows. Its paws, back, and the tip of its tail are all black, and it retains the flared tail-tip of its pre-Evolution Nickit. When Thievul finds a potential target, it will secretly mark a scent on them. Thievul then uses that scent to track and stalk its targets. By using its lithe body and claws, Thievul steals the target’s food and eggs from them when they least expect it. Boltund is an enemy of Thievul. It competes with Liepard for territory."
