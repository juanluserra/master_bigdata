    "pokemon": "Orbeetle",
    "pokedex_number": "0826",
    "origin": "Orbeetle seems to be based on a ladybug, specifically Coccinella septempunctata. Given its high-level intellect, enlarged brain, and use of hypnotism and mind control, it could also be inspired by stereotypical intelligent aliens or \"mad scientist\" antagonists from popular science fiction.",
    "description": "Orbeetle is a beetle-like Pok√©mon with a large head that resembles the body of a ladybug. Its shell is red with seven dark blue spots and a black underside. Six of these seven spots can glow, making concentric cyan and white rings. Orbeetle's face is black and white with yellow antennae that resemble eyebrows, cyan eyes with white rings, and a red stripe above its mouth that resembles a mustache. Its actual body is much smaller and is mostly black with thin limbs, red accents on the pelvis and legs, and sharp pointed yellow feet. It has a sharp protrusion on each of its forearms near the elbow, and its hands have two claws each. Orbeetle are famous for their large brains and high intelligence. Its large brain is proof of the immense psychic power it possesses. Orbeetle emits its psychic powers to study and observe its surroundings, including objects over six miles (ten kilometers) away. Orbeetle rarely use their wings to fly; rather, they use their psychic powers to lift their entire bodies.[citation needed]"
