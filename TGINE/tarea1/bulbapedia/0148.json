    "descripcion": "Dragonair is a long, serpentine reptilian Pokémon with sky blue scales and a white underside. It has a rounded snout, oval purple eyes, and a small, white horn on its forehead. On each side of its head is a small, stylized wing, which is white and curves into a swirl at the base. Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail. Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \"divine Pokémon\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.[1] In Generation II, Dragonair and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
