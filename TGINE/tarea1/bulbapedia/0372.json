    "descripcion": "Shelgon is a quadrupedal Pokémon that resembles a pupal stage. There are bone structures covering its body, which form a shell with two openings and three ridges on top. One opening is in front, revealing two yellow eyes, while the other opening is in the back. This bony covering repels enemy attacks, but it makes Shelgon heavy. Its gray legs are visible protruding from underneath the shell, each with a short red stripe on the inner surface. As a result, this Pokémon moves sluggishly and supposedly never eats or drinks, but it never seems to starve or thirst to death for reasons unknown. Inside the shell, its body is busy forming for its next evolution. It stores the necessary energy needed to evolve, and when it does, its shell begins to peel away. Shelgon can be found in caverns, where it stays still until it evolves."
