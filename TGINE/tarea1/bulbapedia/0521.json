    "pokemon": "Unfezant",
    "pokedex_number": "0521",
    "origin": "Unfezant is based on a pheasant.[1] It especially seems to draw inspiration from the Siamese fireback, a species of pheasant. It may also incorporate aspects of other gamebirds, such as turkeys or the Tragopan. It is also similar in appearance to the greater roadrunner and a King of Saxony bird-of-paradise. Unfezant's gender differences appears to reflect sexual dimorphism in real-life birds in that males have large wattles and are more colorful than the females.",
    "description": "Unfezant is a Pok√©mon resembling a game bird. It is primarily dark gray with lighter gray markings. The light gray markings consist of a heart-shaped patch covering its face and throat, two patches divided by a lacy line on its wings, and intricate stripes with dark rimming on its tail feather. Its beak and eyes are yellow, and it has light gray legs with three clawed toes and a spur on the ankle. The male Unfezant has a reddish-pink wattle around its eyes. Long, ribbon-like growths from the wattle extend over its head and down past its shoulders. By swinging its head, the male threatens its opponents. The male also has a mint green underside with speckling towards the chest. The males are known to fly faster than the females. In contrast, the female lacks a wattle and has brown markings on its underside. It is also more adept at flying than the males due to its stamina. However, the females take a longer time to adjust to people. Unfezant are known to be immensely proud and intelligent. It prefers to not feel close to anyone other than its Trainer."
