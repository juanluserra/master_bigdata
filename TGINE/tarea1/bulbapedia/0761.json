    "description": "Bounsweet is a small Pokémon resembling a mangosteen. Most of its body is pinkish-purple with a short, white bottom around its waist, which resembles the flesh of a mangosteen when it is cut open. It has beady yellow eyes and two tiny legs. On top of its head is a green calyx. This structure consists of four leafy green formations and a short stem. This Pokémon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole or collected by other Pokémon, especially Toucannon and Greedent. It is too sweet for human consumption, but its sweat can be used to make a juice. Bounsweet was highly valued by humans in the past in a time when sweets were rare. While fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward.[1]"
