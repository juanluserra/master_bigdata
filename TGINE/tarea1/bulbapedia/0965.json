    "pokemon": "Varoom",
    "pokedex_number": "0965",
    "origin": "Varoom seems to be based on a single-cylinder internal combustion engine, specifically those found in small engine applications. Its nature as an engine possessed by a Pokémon may be inspired by tsukumogami.",
    "description": "Varoom is an inorganic, metallic Pokémon, said to be created when an unknown Poison-type Pokémon enters and possesses an unused engine at a scrap-processing factory. Its front has a protrusion tipped with a shape somewhat resembling a skull; this shape contains a hole that resembles a frowning mouth. Its two yellow eyes are located on the sides of its body, and on its top is a tall block extending towards the back, with four black stripes decorating it. Its rear has a long exhaust pipe, tipped with a purple stain. Varoom attaches itself to rocks that resemble wheels. These rocks constitute Varoom's diet, as it feeds on minerals from the rocks and converts them into energy. Rather than moving on the ground, Varoom is able to levitate and fly around. Varoom is used by Team Star as the rear wheels of the Starmobiles. Varoom and its evolved form, Revavroom, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spin Out."
