    "descripcion": "Meganium is a quadrupedal, pale-green reptilian Pokémon that resembles a sauropod dinosaur. It has a long neck; yellow eyes; a short, blunt snout; and two stamen-like antennae on top of its snout. The antennae are shorter on a female than on a male. Encircling Meganium's neck are large, pink flower petals with a yellow central pattern and white edges. It has three claws on each foot and a stubby tail. Meganium's petals release an aroma that calms aggressive feelings and its breath has the power to revive dead grass and plants. Its soothing, regenerative powers can even affect those who stand nearby. Meganium tends to be very docile and is portrayed as a peacemaker in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Odd Pokémon Out!. It can rarely be found living in grasslands. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, many Pokémon tend to sleep peacefully side-by-side with Meganium.[1] The reason is fragrance given off by Meganium's flower sooths and calms emotions of any Pokémon fighting near it."
