    "descripcion": "Machamp is a humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and large, pale, yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs[1] and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each. Machamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In Generation VII, Strength was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In Alola, Machamp is used as a Ride Pokémon called Machamp Shove, where Marchamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way. In Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move. "
