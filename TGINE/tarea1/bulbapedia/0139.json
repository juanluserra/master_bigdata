    "descripcion": "Omastar is a cephalopod mollusk Pok√©mon similar to an ammonite or nautilus. Its sky blue body has several tentacles; the tentacles toward the front are shorter and thicker than those in the back. There is a pale yellow, helix spiraled shell on its back. Several sharp spikes line the shell's midsection from the front to about halfway down its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omastar's eyes are visible. Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak. It is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting. Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder. It attacks only when prey comes near its tentacles. Omastar uses its tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. Its fangs are powerful enough to crush through rocks. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery."
