    "descripcion": "Simisear is a simian Pok√©mon that is primarily a bright red color, although its muzzle, chest, upper belly, fingers, and toes are all cream-colored. Its hands have five fingers, and its feet have three toes. Meanwhile, its arms, legs, and lower belly, along with the rest of its head, hands, and feet, are all red. Its upper and lower belly are separated in color at the midsection by a red spike pattern extending upward from its legs. It has large oval eyes and a small black nose, and its ears are broad with orange insides. On its head is a swirled, flame-like red tuft with a smaller tuft on either side; its fluffy, swirled tail resembles a flame as well. Simisear has white, fluffy shoulder ruffs that resemble smoke. Simisear loves sweet foods and consumes them to fuel the flame burning inside its body. When it becomes excited, its body becomes hot, and embers rise from its tail and head tuft. It is also capable of scattering embers from these areas to attack opponents."
