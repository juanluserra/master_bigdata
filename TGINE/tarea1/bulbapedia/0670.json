    "descripcion": "Floette is a small Pokémon with a white upper body and a deep-green lower body. Its eyes are black with a green, leaf-like extension over each similar to eyelashes. It has long, notched ears with a yellow ring around each base. Its tail is spade-shaped, and it has thin arms with mitten-like hands. It has two thin black lines on its head. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Floette also holds a flower with five rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. The flower has three yellow stamens and a long green stem with a single leaf. The color of the flower it uses remains the same, even after evolving.[1] The more gorgeous the flower, the more power that it contains for Floette to use. Floette is unable to use moves by itself, but when it synchronizes with flowers, it becomes able to use Grass-type moves, with White Flower Floette being capable of easily synchronizing with flowers of other colors. Floette can restore withered flowers to perfect health by drawing forth what power is left in them. It can also draw forth the latent capabilities of Grass types. It flutters around and cares for withered flowers by giving its own power to them. If the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, Floette celebrates with an elegant dance. However, it will never forgive anyone who tramples a flowerbed and will attack them mercilessly. Prior to Generation VII, Floette and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities."
