    "descripcion": "Pupitar is a Pokémon encased inside a thick grayish-blue shell, sporting a hardness that is comparable to bedrock. Its red eyes can be seen through two holes in the shell, and two more holes directly above resemble eyebrows. The upper portion of its body is covered by a mask-like plate with four large spikes on either side. Three additional spikes protrude from its forehead, and another pair of spikes are visible on either side of its lower body. While its arms and legs are developing inside the shell, Pupitar uses compressed gas to propel itself around, and can generate enough force to knock down mountains. Pupitar even performs this technique even when it sleeps. Pupitar lives and moves freely around harsh mountain ranges. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Pupitar is known to move around even when sleeping.[1]"
