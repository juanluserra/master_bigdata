    "descripcion": "Spritzee is a pink, avian Pokémon. It has a rounded body and a pale blue-gray face. Most of its facial area is taken up by its curved beak, which somewhat resembles a plague doctor's mask. It has large red-orange eyes with long black lashes. On top of its head is a curly tuft of feathers or fur. It has small wings and purple feet with no visible digits. Spritzee emits a scent that varies based on its diet and enraptures those around it using a scent pouch. In the past, royal ladies carried Spritzee with them instead of using perfume. Prior to Generation VIII, Spritzee and its pre-evolved form, Aromatisse, were the only known Pokémon that could have Aroma Veil as an Ability."
