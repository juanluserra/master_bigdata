    "pokedex_number": "0048",
    "origin": "Venonat seems to draw inspiration from multiple insects, which may include fleas, mites, flies, owlflies, flightless moths, and/or venomous caterpillars. Its large compound eyes function like radar and resemble parabolic antennas.",
    "description": "Venonat is an insect Pok√©mon with a spherical body covered in purple fur. The fur releases a toxic liquid and it spreads when shaken violently off their bodies. A pink pincer-like mouth with two teeth, stubby forepaws, and a pair of two-toed feet are visible through its fur. Its limbs are light tan. There is also a pair of white antennae sprouting from the top of its head. However, the most prominent feature on its face are its large, red compound eyes. Venonat's highly developed eyes act as radar units and can shoot powerful beams. Venonat can be found in dense temperate forests, where it will sleep in the hole of a tree until nightfall. It sleeps throughout the day because the small insects it feeds on appear only at night. Both Venonat and its prey are attracted to bright lights. "
