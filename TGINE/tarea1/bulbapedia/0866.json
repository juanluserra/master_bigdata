    "descripcion": "Mr. Rime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Like its pre-evolved form Mr. Mime, it has growths resembling clown hair, but they are now black rather than blue and they cover the top of its head, resembling a bowler hat. It has yellow eyes and a moustache that covers its mouth. Its black-and-white torso resembles a coat or tuxedo and a face, with yellow shirt studs for its \"eyes\", a red lump as its \"nose\", and a white cummerbund for its \"mouth\". While its actual face remains almost expressionless, the features on its torso will change to convey emotions. Its lower body is blue and it has black and blue feet that resemble large shoes, presumably capped with ice. It has black spherical shoulders and blue arms with white, mitten-like hands. It always carries a blue formal cane made of ice. Mr. Rime is highly skilled in tap dancing and waves its ice cane while it moves gracefully. It is popular due to its amusing movements and has been known to influence the Mime Jr. of the Galar region to learn its dancing steps, leading them to evolve into Galarian Mr. Mime. It can release psychic powers through the pattern on its belly. Mr. Rime and its pre-Evolution, Galarian Mr. Mime, are the only known Pokémon that can have Screen Cleaner as an Ability."
