    "pokemon": "Bronzor",
    "pokedex_number": "0436",
    "origin": "Bronzor is based on a 銅鏡 dōkyō, or bronze mirror. On its back, Bronzor has carved in a shape of a grain spike just like its evolved form, Bronzong, which can summon rain for better harvest.",
    "description": "Bronzor is a flat, circular, blue-green Pokémon. Six dark blue spheres bulge from its rim. It has two round, yellow eyes and a large nose-like sphere surrounded by four small circles in its center. A crest resembling an herb or branch is on its back. Bronzor's crest is said to possess a mysterious power and is held sacred. It was first seen in ancient tombs and timeworn places; objects resembling this Pokémon have also been found in tombs. Scientists believe Bronzor used to be reflective and have unsuccessfully tried performing X-rays on its body. The pattern of Bronzor in Galar cannot be found in any of its cultures, and the reason is unknown. There is lore on how polishing Bronzor will make its surface reflect the truth. However, it hates being polished. Bronzor uses an unknown energy to help it float around. It typically lives in mountainous paths. Prior to Generation VIII, Bronzor and its evolved form, Bronzong, were the only known Pokémon that could have Heatproof as an Ability."
