    "descripcion": "Orthworm is a long, worm-like Pokémon with a six-segmented metal body. Its body is red on top and light orange on the bottom, except for its second segment, which is steel-colored. The first segment is its head, which contains its small, pale blue eyes and a large, toothless mouth. There are pairs of cyan ovals lining either side of its body from its third to fifth segments, while its second segment has three of such pairs. Parapodia-like tendrils can extend from the ovals on its second segment, which resemble simple fists. When threatened, Orthworm uses its blue fist-like parapodia to pelt its opponent with a storm of punches. It lives in dry deserts, and eats iron from the soil to maintain its body. It is sometimes seen buried in the ground, with only its head visible. A giant Orthworm, known as the Lurking Steel Titan, is one of the Titan Pokémon found in Paldea. It mainly resides near a cavern in East Province (Area Three) where it feeds on Salty Herba Mystica inside a hidden cave. Orthworm is the only known Pokémon that can have Earth Eater as an Ability."
