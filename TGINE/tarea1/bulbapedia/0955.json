    "pokedex_number": "0955",
    "origin": "Flittle's appearance may be based on the chicks of various bird species. The frills on its body resemble a frilled dress or gown. Its overall body shape may also be inspired by an ostrich egg or the dumbo octopus. It also remotely resembles a U.F.O., specifically a flying saucer.",
    "description": "Flittle is a small Pok√©mon resembling a bird chick, with a yellow body, large blue eyes with a lavender triangular mark between them, and a small lavender mouth. It has white frills on its head and both yellow and pink frills extending from its belly, which it uses to emit psychic energy. Its pointed feet are extremely small and appear to serve no use in movement, dangling from its body as it levitates above the ground. Flittle spends most of its time roaming wastelands and mountainous regions. Flittle is also known to be quite vengeful. Should anyone steal Flittle's berries, it will chase after them for revenge."
