    "descripcion": "Sealeo is a bright-blue, pinniped Pokémon. Its throat and chest are beige with speckling around the edges. There are two short tusks protruding from its upper jaw, and it has dark brown, oval eyes. It has a powerful pair of front flippers, which are able to crush ice. Additionally, it has a short, flipper-like tail. On the sides of its blunt muzzle are thick, white whiskers. Sealeo's white whiskers are described as being super sensitive. When a Sealeo encounters new objects, they are placed on its nose and rolled around to test its smell and texture. The reason is to determine if it likes the object or not. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Sealeo can sense the environment even when it sleeps. It has also been known to roll Spheal or Poké Balls on its nose. The reason Sealeo does this to Spheal is to check its scent and ensure it is still healthy. This Pokémon lives in the sea and on drift ice. Sealeo dives underwater to hunt for prey five times a day. It searches for the prey by its scent. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
