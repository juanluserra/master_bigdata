    "descripcion": "Burmy is a small, larval Pokémon with a black segmented body and a coiled antenna on top of its head. It has a beak-like mouth and yellow eyes. Burmy has six stubby legs: the first two pairs are black, while the back pair is yellow. There are also two white spots on its cheeks. However, Burmy's legs and cheek spots are only visible on a Burmy without a cloak. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Some Enchanted Sweetening! it can uncoil the antenna on its head and wrap it around its opponent. Remoraid is a natural predator of Burmy."
