    "descripcion": "Wimpod is a small, arthropod Pokémon. Its main body is purple and is covered by silver plating across its back. There are four plates in total. The first plate covers half of its head but leaves room for its eyes. The upper lids of its eyes appear to be covered with additional plating. The three plates on its back overlap and each one has a single black triangle in the middle. It has a long spike on each side of its head that curves backward, large yellow eyes with two short extensions over them like eyelashes, and two flat antennae that extend over its back. There are eight short legs on its underside, and it has a long, prickly tail. This Pokémon is cowardly by nature and wary of both noise and sudden movements. However, its curiosity will cause it to approach people or Pokémon that are standing still. It will spit a poisonous liquid when threatened. Wimpod sometimes accompanies its evolved form, Golisopod. The stench of this fluid warns others that danger is nearby. Wimpod will eat and store anything, including garbage from the sea. This habit makes them highly valued as cleaners.[1] When it finds coins, Murkrow and Meowth go after it. Wimpod is the only known Pokémon that can have Wimp Out as an Ability."
