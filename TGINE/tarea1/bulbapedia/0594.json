    "pokemon": "Alomomola",
    "pokedex_number": "0594",
    "origin": "Alomomola appears to be a combination of an ocean sunfish and a heart representing health. Due to its hand-like fins and heart shaped body, it may have been inspired by the Claddagh ring. Its ability to heal other Pokémon may be inspired by the doctor fish. The fact that it wraps itself in a special membrane might be a reference to a parrotfish, or the nourishing secretions of the discus fish. Alomomola being found in locations with the Jellicent line reflects the ocean sunfish's diet of jellyfish.",
    "description": "Alomomola is a pink, fishlike Pokémon with darker pink markings on its heart-shaped body and fins. It has large dorsal and ventral fins resembling hands, each divided into four sections and tipped with a paler pink. The shape of the Pokémon resembles an ocean sunfish, as it lacks a proper tail fin. Its eyes are round with golden irises and a mark that appears to be an eyelash extending up and back toward the rest of the body. Alomomola's entire body is enveloped in a special membrane that can heal wounds. Alomomola lives in the open seas. If it finds an injured Pokémon floating at sea, it will heal the Pokémon's wounds using its membrane and carry it back to shore. Alomomola does this because any predators coming for the injured Pokémon could also come for Alomomola. Alomomola swims alongside smaller Pokémon to accompany them; thus, many water Pokémon gather around it. Fishermen take Alomomola during long voyages, saving the need to have a doctor or medicine on ships."
