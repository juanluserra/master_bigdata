    "pokemon": "Bellossom",
    "pokedex_number": "0182",
    "origin": "Bellossom seems to be based on a stereotypical hula dancer. The leaves encircling its body resemble a grass skirt, which was popularized in Hawaii through tourism. The flowers adorning its head resemble both plumeria in concept, which are commonly worn in the hair and used to make leis, and Rafflesia keithii in shape, which relates to its pre-evolved form Gloom. It is also reminiscent of a bell due to its body shape and the ringing sound it produces as described in its Pokédex entries.",
    "description": "Bellossom is a primarily green flowering plant Pokémon with circular blue eyes and red markings on its cheeks. It has two bright red Rafflesia-like flowers on its head and green and yellow leaves around its waist that resemble a skirt, all adding to the appearance of a hula dancer. Bellossom's petals are said to be more beautiful the worse the aroma of the Gloom it evolved from. When it rubs the petals on its head together, it creates a pleasing sound. Bellossom does not possess feet; in the Pokémon the Series episode Flower Power, its center-most leaves bent as it was getting ready to spring, suggesting that it uses its leaves as substitutes for feet or legs. However, the Pokédex does classify it as a biped. Bellossom is often seen dancing and chanting. In particular, Bellossom dances when cloudy weather persists, or when the heavy rainfall season ends and it is drawn out by the warm sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Bellossom is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains, and are more plentiful in the tropics."
