    "descripcion": "Crustle is an orange Pok√©mon resembling an insect or crustacean. Its most distinguishing feature is its enormous, hard shell, which resembles a cut-away block of sediment with multiple layers and strata visible.  The tips of its pincers and six feet are dark gray. It has two glaring yellow eyes. Crustle possesses a straight tail that is concealed underneath its shell. Its legs are very strong, to the point that it can carry heavy rocks for a long time, even through the arid lands where it resides. Due to this environment, a Crustle will not come out of its shell if it is a rainy day. It fights members of its species over territory in battles which can become very vicious. If its shell breaks during such a fight, it loses. When Crustle's shell breaks, it will become weaker and unsure of itself. Crustle's biggest strength is its thick claws; being strong enough to break even Rhyperior's sturdy carapace."
