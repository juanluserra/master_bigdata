    "descripcion": "Hatenna is a small Pokémon with a round pink body and a pair of small feet. Most of its body is covered by a blue wig-like feature with a pink, hat-like erect tail. This tail is decorated with a white spot and has a blue bulbous growth on its tip. The flaps on the side of its head appear to be able to function like limbs. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. The tail protrusion on Hatenna's head constantly senses and captures other creatures' emotions. As such, Hatenna is a reclusive Pokémon, preferring to live in uninhabited areas. It tends to run away as fast as possible when it senses strong emotions, as exposure to it for too long will make Hatenna tired. It never warms up to anyone that does not have a calm disposition."
