    "descripcion": "Sawsbuck is a brown and cream, deer-like Pok√©mon with rhomboid ears and darker ear insides. Its eyes have light-orange markings that curve down to the sides of its face. It has a dark-brown nose, and it sports cream fur on its chin and sides of its face. Light-orange stripes rim its underbelly, and its back is decorated with spots. Its appearance changes depending on the season. During the spring, a tuft of cream fur appears on its chest, its antlers are adorned with pink flowers, and the spots on its back are pink. During the summer, its tail points up, it grows tufts of fur on the back of its head, its antlers sport green leaves, and its spots are green. During the fall, it sports a cream tuft of fur on its chest, the leaves on its antlers are red and brown, and its spots are orange. During the winter, the cream fur turns white, tufts of white fur appear on its chest and lower limbs, its antlers are coated in white, and its spots are white. Sawsbuck lives in herds led by the Sawsbuck with the most splendid antlers. In Generation V, Horn Leech was its signature move."
