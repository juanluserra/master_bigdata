    "descripcion": "Braviary is a large, avian Pok√©mon with dark red feathers on its back and dark blue feathers on its underside. Its tail feathers are red, turning to yellow, and then blue at the tips. Braviary's legs are long and thick with yellow feet that each have a digit facing backward, and three facing forward. Each digit is tipped by a short, thick, black claw. Braviary has a long, thick beak with a blue cere. On either side of the cere are Braviary's eyes, which are black with small white pupils. Sprouting from above the eyes is a crest of three long, white feathers. At the base of the feathers is a red, W-shaped design that is spread across all three feathers. On each side of Braviary's face, sprouting out from behind the feathers on its forehead, are an additional three white feathers pointing horizontally and downward. Behind the three feathers on its head is a large mane of white feathers, draping over its neck. Combined, these features resemble a Native American war bonnet. Braviary is extremely aggressive, but for noble reasons. It is known for its bravery and pride, and will fight fiercely to help and protect its friends. Even if it is injured or has its life threatened, it will still fight. The more scars it has on its front, the more respect it gets from its peers. Scars on its back will bring it ridicule, however. It has earned the nickname \"the hero of the skies\" due to its extreme dedication for its friends. Aiding its valiance, Braviary is extremely strong, capable of lifting a car and flying with it. However, due to its hotheaded and belligerent nature, it was rejected from being the Flying Taxi carrier in Galar in favor of Corviknight. Braviary is usually seen as a motif for different emblems."
