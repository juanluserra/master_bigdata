    "pokemon": "Baxcalibur",
    "pokedex_number": "0998",
    "origin": "Baxcalibur may draw inspiration from kaiju. Its upright posture may allude to how most kaiju are humanoid in shape, due to the need to fit a human actor inside the creature suit in kaiju films. It also has traits of certain species of dinosaurs, most notably Concavenator, a theropod dinosaur which had a crest on its back and quills on its forelimbs. Fossils of the genus were first discovered in Spain, and the crest is hypothesized to have functioned as a tool of thermoregulation.",
    "description": "Baxcalibur is a large, theropod-like Pokémon whose body is predominantly navy blue in color. It has a series of hexagon-shaped ice patches located near its chest area, on its kneecaps, and underneath its tail. It also has squareish polygonal light blue patches underneath its feet. It has long muscular arms and three sharp white claws on its hands and feet, along with three red quills protruding from each of its wrists. It appears to be wearing an icy mask on its face, with a pair of ice spikes pointing upward on its snout and icicles pointing downward on its chin. The only part of the face not covered in ice is its yellow eyes. The black, ice-coated spine on its back resembles an axe. When in battle, Baxcalibur flips upside-down, using its spine as an axe while supporting itself with its head and forelimbs. It also spews out cryogenic air from its mouth, which is cold enough to freeze lava. To finish opponents off, it launches towards them with the blade on its back. Baxcalibur is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Glaive Rush. Baxcalibur and its pre-evolved forms are also the only known Pokémon that can have Thermal Exchange as an Ability."
