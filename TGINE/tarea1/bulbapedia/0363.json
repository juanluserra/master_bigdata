    "descripcion": "Spheal is a chubby, spherical, seal-like Pokémon with a short, flat tail. Its plushy fur is light blue with several white spots of various sizes on its back. This covering of fluffy fur, combined with the layer of blubber underneath, retains heat and protects Spheal from the cold. It has black, circular eyes; small tusks protruding from its upper jaw; and small, rounded ears. Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige. When it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pokémon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of Spheal have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pokémon lives in and around the sea. Spheal also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. Spheal are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo, which does so to check the former's health. When a Spheal finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Spheal has been seen clapping its fins merrily while asleep on its back. It has led to those being curious about what happy things Spheal is dreaming about once it awakens. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
