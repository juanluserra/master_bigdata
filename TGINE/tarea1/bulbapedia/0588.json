    "descripcion": "Karrablast is a round, bipedal Pok√©mon with a primarily blue carapace that comprises a horn at the tip. Its black face has a teal patch on its forehead, a fanged mouth, and eyes with orange pupils and yellow sclerae. Its ridged underbelly, or plastron, is yellow, and its stubby arms and legs are black. When it senses danger, it spews an acidic liquid from its mouth. It targets its rival Shelmet, so it can evolve through electrical-like energy. Shelmet is also the preferred prey of Karrablast, as it eats the inside after melting the shell.  It resides in forests and fields, and it often hides in trees or grass if threatened."
