    "descripcion": "Nidoqueen is a large, bipedal blue mammalian Pokémon with distinct reptilian features. Its body is encased with extremely hard scales that serve as excellent protection from any attack and stand up when Nidoqueen is excited or provoked. It has a blunt snout, narrow brown eyes, and large ears with brown insides. There is a small horn on its forehead, a single spine on each ear, and a line of toxic spikes running down its back. Each hand has three short claws, and each foot has two claws. Its lower jaw, the front of its abdomen, and two plates on its chest are cream-colored. It has a thick, powerful tail. Nidoqueen is a female-only species. As stated in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS, it cannot lay Eggs as it loses the ability to do so upon evolution. Nidoqueen can be quite fierce and is very protective of its young. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young, and it will try to seal the entrance to its burrow to protect them. It also places its young in the gaps between the spines on its back, which never release poison when the children are present. Nidoqueen is more adept at being defensive than offensive. Nidoqueen's armor-like scales allow it to defend its children from any attack. When in contact with foes, it can poison them with the spikes on its back or cause small tremors by slamming the ground. It is also adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles, and it uses its hefty bulk to execute powerful moves. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Nidoqueen is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains."
