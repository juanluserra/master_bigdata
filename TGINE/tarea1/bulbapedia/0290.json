    "pokedex_number": "0290",
    "origin": "Nincada appears to be based on a cicada nymph. Its association with ninjas may be inspired by stories of ninjas using cicadas to mask their own sounds, or a reference to fabled ninja techniques: doton no jutsu (escape jutsu), a technique of sneaking into a pre-dug hole and hiding until the opponent is gone and utsusemi no jutsu (cicada skin technique), a technique using decoys to misdirect opponents.",
    "description": "Nincada is a small, whitish, insectoid Pok√©mon. It has a pointed snout, a thin stripe that dips in a V-shaped pattern between its eyes, and two whisker-like antennae on its face. Its eyes are black with green iris-like rings inside. As it is virtually blind, it uses its antennae to sense its surroundings. On its back is a pair of small, green wings. Its hind legs are white, but the forelegs are brown and have sharp claws. The claws are used to carve into the roots of trees and absorb moisture and nutrients. Nincada builds underground nests at the roots of trees in tropical and temperate forests. It can occasionally live up to 10 years underground. It does not like sunlight, so it avoids it. Nincada is nearly blind due to living almost entirely underground, as such, it uses its antennae to see instead."
