    "descripcion": "Slurpuff is a white, bipedal Pokémon. It has reddish-pink eyes with white pupils and is usually seen with its tongue poking out of the corner of its mouth. When its mouth is open, two upper fangs can be seen. On top of its head is a mass of fluffy pink fur with a red cherry-like sphere on top. On either side of its head, its pink fur forms a spherical shape similar to ears. Around its neck is a wavy, red collar and there is a red spot on the left side of its chest. It has small, pink feet with three toes and stubby arms. Slurpuff has an exceptionally keen sense of smell that is 100 million times stronger than that of a human. This allows it to distinguish even the faintest of smells and assist pastry chefs in the cooking. Slurpuff can tell a person's mental and physical condition by taking in their scent. Its fur contains a lot of air, making it light and soft to the touch. Prior to Generation VII, Slurpuff and its pre-evolved form, Swirlix, were the only known Pokémon that could have Sweet Veil as an Ability."
