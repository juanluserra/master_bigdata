    "pokemon": "Carvanha",
    "pokedex_number": "0318",
    "origin": "Carvanha appears to be based on a piranha, with its red underside particularly bringing to mind the red-bellied piranha. The star on its underside may allude to sharks like starspotted smooth-hound or starry smooth-hound.",
    "description": "Carvanha is a fish Pokémon with a body covered in tiny, sharp denticles. The top half of its spherical body is blue, while the bottom half is red with a yellow, four-pointed star below its mouth. It has two yellow dorsal fins above its eyes that resemble shark fins, and a matching pelvic fin on its belly. Its pectoral fins are also yellow. The caudal fin is composed of two red spines with a thin yellow membrane stretched between them. It has powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth that are able to chew through solid steel, rip up boat hulls, and rip wooden boats to pieces. As a result, sailors avoid getting their boats dented by it at all costs. Carvanha has been responsible for the destruction of many boats that come into contact with it. They mercilessly swarm any intruder and prey that invades their territory, but they become timid when alone. It only attacks when in a group of five or more, becoming instantly vicious. Carvanha is drawn towards the scent of blood. It lives in rivers that course through jungles, as well as temperate regions. Each Carvanha school has its own territory. It competes with Basculin for food. Prior to Generation V, Carvanha and its evolved form, Sharpedo, were the only known Pokémon that could have Rough Skin as an Ability."
