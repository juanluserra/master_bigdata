    "descripcion": "Tyrunt is a bipedal, dinosaurian Pokémon that resembles a large theropod. Its body is grayish-brown with a small hump on its back, and its belly and lower jaw are a lighter gray. The head is large in proportion to its body and has a blunt snout with a ridge above the nostrils. Two teeth are visible in the lower jaw, while the upper jaw has two tooth-like spikes. On top of its head are two orange spikes and it has a black around the lower edge of each eye. Around its neck is a spiky ruff of white, primitive feathers. It has tiny forelimbs with two white claws each. The hind legs are more developed and have rectangular, armor plating over the knees, three white claws on each foot, and a smaller, fourth digit lacking a claw off to the side. Its tail is short with an orange spike near the tip. Tyrunt has a selfish, spoiled nature. If it encounters something it dislikes, it will throw a violent tantrum and run wild. Its strong jaws have enough force to shred an automobile, and it tends to unknowingly inflict injuries while playing, even on its Trainer. This Pokémon lived 100 million years ago; theories suggest it might have had a different form then."
