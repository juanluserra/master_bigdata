    "descripcion": "Lokix is a bipedal, insectoid Pok√©mon which resembles a locust. It is primarily dark gray, with glossy black colorations on the head, thorax, lower abdomen, forearms, lower legs, and third set of legs. Its face is covered in a mask-like plate, and contains a pair of black triangular antennae with two white stripes on top, along with orange triangular eyes and a triangular notch on its chin. Its thorax and abdomen are separated by a white belt, with an X-shaped pattern at the front. It has a pair of white claws on each of its hands, and a single claw on each foot. Its forearms have an orange spike each, while its calves have two orange spikes protruding towards the back. Behind Lokix's body is its third set of legs, attached to its abdomen. These legs are oblong with a symbol resembling the general prohibition sign on the outside of the joints, and connect to thin, rectangular forelimbs. Each of the forelimbs have five orange spikes and a single white claw at the bottom. Lokix usually keeps its third set of legs folded on its back; however, it can unfold these legs to enter what is known as its Showdown Mode. In Showdown Mode, Lokix stands and jumps on its now-unfolded third set of legs, and swings them to attack. Lokix utilizes its Showdown Mode to fight all-out, being capable of quickly subduing its foes in this mode. However, it cannot be in Showdown Mode for too long, as it places a huge strain on its body. Lokix can live in a variety of different areas in Paldea, such as grasslands, snowy mountains, deserts, and lakes."
