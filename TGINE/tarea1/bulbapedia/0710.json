    "pokemon": "Pumpkaboo",
    "pokedex_number": "0710",
    "origin": "Pumpkaboo appears to be based on a pumpkin, specifically the ones carved into jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween. Pumpkins are also known for their variety of sizes, possibly contributing to the four sizes Pumpkaboo comes in. Considering its fangs, black upper body, and affiliation with Halloween, it may also be based on bats or black cats, which are also associated with the holiday.",
    "description": "Pumpkaboo is a ghostly pumpkin-like Pokémon that varies dramatically in size. Encasing its lower body is a pinkish pumpkin with a pair of nubby legs. Carved into the pumpkin is a pair of circular holes that glow yellow-orange. Pumpkaboo's shadowy black body pokes out of the top of the pumpkin. It has glowing yellow eyes, a pair of fangs in its upper jaw, and pointed ears that curve slightly. On top of its head is a long tuft of fur that curls tightly at the tip. A collar of furry-looking tufts hangs over the edge of the pumpkin. Pumpkaboo becomes active after dark. The holes in its body can glow and illuminate the way for travelers in the dark. It is said that it also carries wandering spirits to the afterlife by storing the spirits in its body. However, its own spirit is trapped in this world. Pumpkaboo can hypnotize and control any humans or Pokémon. It does this task by releasing streams of light from the holes in the pumpkin. Pumpkaboo and its evolved form Gourgeist are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Trick-or-Treat."
