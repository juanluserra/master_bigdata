    "descripcion": "Caterpie is an insect Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort. Caterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon. It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot. On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva[1]."
