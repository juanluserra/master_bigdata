    "descripcion": "Ledian is a coleopteran insectoid Pok√©mon that resembles a slightly humanoid ladybug. It has a pair of black antennae, a black spot in the center of its forehead and on the back of its head, blue eyes, and a cream-colored area around its mouth; the rest of its head is red. The antennae are shorter on the female than on the male. Its back and the top of its elytra are red with black spots, while the underside of its body and elytra are cream-colored; in Mewtwo Returns, the spots are shown to flash red at night. Underneath its elytra are a pair of clear wings. Its neck and limbs are black. It has four arms with white hands that resemble boxing gloves and a pair of legs with red feet. Ledian sleeps wrapped in leaves or grass in temperate and tropical forests during the day. At night, it flutters around scattering a glowing powder that is thought to bring good luck. It is believed to use starlight as energy and the patterns on its back grow larger or smaller depending on the number of stars in the sky. In addition to starlight, it loves to eat Berries. A weak fighter, it tries for quantity over power by throwing a barrage of punches with all four of its arms."
