    "pokemon": "Wynaut",
    "pokedex_number": "0360",
    "origin": "Wynaut maybe based on an Okiagari-koboshi doll, a Japanese traditional doll with squinted eyes that stands back upright when pushed over. It is a symbol of perseverance.",
    "description": "Wynaut is a small, bipedal Pokémon covered in blue fur. Its head is spherical with ear-like, fingerless arms on either side and a bulbous growth on its forehead. It has a wide mouth with a serrated upper jaw and a pink tongue. Its eyes appear closed, each curving upward to a point in the center. The fur on its body ends in a zigzag pattern, extending over its short legs. Wynaut's tail is long and completely black, ending in a round, flattened tip with a white, eye-like spot. Wynaut tends to live in caves and travel in herds. It will test its endurance by squeezing up against other Wynaut at night. In doing so, it strengthens itself, toughens its spirit, and learns to launch powerful counterattacks. When angered, it will slap the ground with its tail. As it loves to eat sweet fruit, it is also drawn to fruit gardens. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Wynaut maintains its smile even while sleeping. Slapping the ground with its black tail is a possible sign that Wynaut is feeling restless and angry in it sleep. Prior to Generation V, Wynaut and its evolved form, Wobbuffet, were the only known Pokémon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability."
