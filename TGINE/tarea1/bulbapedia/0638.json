    "descripcion": "Cobalion is a quadrupedal Pokémon that possesses traits of stags and goats. It is covered in aqua blue fur and has jagged yellow horns similar in shape to thunderbolts. Its snout is a lighter shade of blue than the rest of its fur, and there is a black blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. On its long neck and hind legs, there are small gray spots. It has a white tuft of fur under its neck, resembling a cravat. On its shoulder blades are yellow protrusions that resemble fins. Its tail resembles these protrusions, albeit in the same color as its snout. Cobalion's legs have black bands with lighter fur underneath and large black hooves. Cobalion's body is said to be made of steel. According to legend, Cobalion, alongside the other Swords of Justice had challenged the humans in order to protect other Pokémon from losing their homes to the humans's expansion. During the battle, Cobalion ushered the other Pokémon to safety. The three Swords distrust humans because of a war that resulted in a forest fire in Moor of Icirrus. Its glare can make even an unruly Pokémon obey it. Cobalion is said to have possessed the air of a leader since its birth, and is capable of calming even the most vicious of foes. As seen in both Pokémon the Series and Pokémon Adventures, it can create an energy blade out of its head. Cobalion loves Cobalion Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and followed it in the past. Cobalion shares a resemblance to Iron Crown, which is believed to be a descendant of Cobalion or a cutting-edge weapon that merely resembles it. In Generation V, Sacred Sword was its signature move."
