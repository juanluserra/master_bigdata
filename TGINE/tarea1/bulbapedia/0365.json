    "pokemon": "Walrein",
    "pokedex_number": "0365",
    "origin": "Walrein appears to be based on a walrus. Its body shape, blue coloration, and fluffy white fur are reminiscent of a breaking wave. The rings around its neck may be inspired by the ribbon seal's coloration.",
    "description": "Walrein is a large, walrus-like Pokémon with a layer of blubber under its skin. It is primarily blue, with thin, white rings around its neck and lines on its fan-like tail-fin. There are two long, ivory tusks in its upper jaw. It has a round snout and yellow eyes, and large tufts of white fur about its face and neck. Its four short legs have long flippers instead of feet. Walrein lives in and around icy seas, where it is insulated against the cold by its thick layer of blubber. This layer of fat also protects it from enemy attacks by causing them to bounce off. While its long tusks are capable of crushing ice up to 10 tons in one blow, they may break during battle. Walrein's tusks grow continuously throughout its life, and any broken ones will grow back by the following year. The Hisui region is famous for the many broken tusks of Walrein that can be found there. This Pokémon can be found in herds of 20 to 30 individuals, which are fiercely protected by the leader. The leader is willing to give up its life in order to protect the herd. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Walrein has been seen sleeping with a tusk stuck in the ground. It is believed that the Pokémon fell asleep while tending to it tusks. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."
