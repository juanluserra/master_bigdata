    "description": "Cascoon is a round, cocoon-like Pok√©mon. It is covered in purple silk, except for two holes where its red eyes are visible. The soft silk hardens into a tough cocoon that is able to endure attacks, and Cascoon will not move even when it is attacked. However, it never forgets the pain it endures and seeks revenge upon Evolution. It lives in forests, where it hides underneath large leaves and inside the gaps of tree branches. Additionally, it camouflages itself by attaching dead leaves to its body. As its cells create energy for Evolution, the inside of the cocoon becomes hot. Cracks start to form in its casing when Evolution is near. Cascoon's silk is said to be thin yet strong, with a luster and texture superior to the silk from its counterpart Silcoon. Cascoon's silk is used to make high-quality clothing."
