    "descripcion": "Vanilluxe is a two-headed Pokémon covered in swirled, white snow that overall resembles two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. It is the result of two Vanillish stuck together after a daylight melting and nighttime freezing process. Each head has two light purple eyes and a mouth. There are light blue ice crystals to the side of each eye and two under each mouth. It has two stubby arms and three spikes under its body, all of which resemble icicles. The middle spike under its body is the largest, and there is a hollow, straw-like structure on top of the left head. On the back of its two heads there are many small ice crystals. Vanilluxe has a body temperature of about 21 °F (−6 °C). It ingests large quantities of water, which it uses to create internal snow clouds. If it loses a head, it can still live problem-free. When its two heads are in agreement or simultaneously angered, it can expel powerful blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, which makes it popular among skiers and snowboarders."
