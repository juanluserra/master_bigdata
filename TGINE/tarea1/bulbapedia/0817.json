    "descripcion": "Drizzile is a slim, lizard-like Pok√©mon. It is primarily blue with a white belly and a dark blue mark above it. It has lime green mitten-like hands and two-digit feet. On its face, it has small nostrils, half-lidded eyes with green eyelids, a thin line connecting its eyes, and a blue dot next to each eye. On its head are three hairlike structures, two dark blue and one purple. One of the structures sticks up like a cowlick. The other two droop over the face and cover one eye, resembling \"emo\" bangs. Inside its mouth, Drizzile has a long, mucus-coated tongue that can be used for catching prey or attacking opponents.[1] Like its pre-evolved form, Sobble, it has a chameleon tail that swirls inward. Drizzile uses special pores in its palms to secrete moisture, which it forms into water balloons that it uses to attack. Drizzile is highly intelligent, capable of devising strategies or using its surroundings to enact hit-and-run tactics. However, it is also exceptionally lazy and prefers to not do anything unless it has to. It makes its home inside tree hollows or rocks. It is very cautious, and lays out traps everywhere around its territory to keep enemies out. Like its evolutionary relatives, it also has the ability to camouflage itself when wet.[1] Drizzile typically moves on all fours, although it can stand and walk on two legs. Drizzile will use its long, slimy tongue to first attack its prey with blinding speeds before finishing it off with great skill."
