    "pokemon": "Tirtouga",
    "pokedex_number": "0564",
    "origin": "Tirtouga appears to be based on a baby sea turtle, more specifically, a leatherback. It also may be based on Protostega, a large, prehistoric sea turtle. The Protostega is one of the largest known species of turtles, second only to the Archelon, which its evolution, Carracosta, may be based on.",
    "description": "Tirtouga is a reptilian Pokémon resembling a baby leatherback sea turtle. Its body is blue with black spots on the edges of its flippers. Its black shell has six circular indentations in it. Its upper beak and parts of its face are black, and together resemble a mask. It has a light blue patch underneath its eyes. Tirtouga's shell is very tough, and it can dive down to depths of as much as 1,000 meters. Tirtouga was known to actively hunt for prey to the extent that it would go on land to reach them. Tirtouga lived in the ancient oceans from about 100 million years ago. It now exists in the present thanks to being revived from fossils. Tirtouga is believed to be the ancestor of most turtle Pokémon."
