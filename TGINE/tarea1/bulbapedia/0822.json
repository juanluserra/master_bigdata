    "descripcion": "Corvisquire is a crow-like, avian Pokémon. Its tail and dorsal feathers have a navy coloration, and its breast feathers are blue-gray. Matte black feathers accent its wing-tips, ruff, and face, which is adorned with a mask-like crest. Its beak and three-toed feet are gray, and it has black talons. Corvisquire's eyes are red, and rimmed beneath with a white patch. Corvisquire's brain is large relative to those of other bird Pokémon, which is thought to be the reason behind its high intelligence level. Corvisquire are intelligent enough to use tools in battle, having been seen to throw rocks at their opponents or use vines to entangle them. Over the course of many tough battles, they learn to assess the strength of prospective opponents before engaging them. Corvisquire preys on Steenee."
