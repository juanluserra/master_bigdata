    "pokedex_number": "0066",
    "origin": "Machop appears to be based on a bodybuilder. It also possesses some reptilian features such as its face, three plate-like crests on its head, a tail, and blue-gray coloration.",
    "description": "Machop is a humanoid, bipedal Pok√©mon that has blue-gray skin. It has three brown ridges on top of its head, large red eyes, and a relatively flat face. On either side of its chest are three, thin, rib-like stripes. Its feet appear to have no toes, while its hands have five fingers. Machop also has a short, stubby tail. Machop's entire body is covered with muscles that will never tire or cramp. With these muscles, it can lift many times its own body weight; it is even capable of hurling up to 100 adults. It spends its time and energy working out and practicing all different forms of martial arts, striving to improve its abilities. One of its daily training routines involves lifting boulders and Graveler repeatedly as if they were barbells. It becomes more dedicated the more its muscles grow. Once it feels confident, it challenges Makuhita to a battle. Machop lives in the mountains, and its diet includes highly nutritious food that allows it to efficiently build up its muscles. In Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move."
