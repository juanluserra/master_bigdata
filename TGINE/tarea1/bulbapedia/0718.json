    "descripcion": "Zygarde is a green and black Pokémon whose form depends on the percentage of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells it has gathered together. The Cores and Cells do not have the power to battle alone and can only fight when combined to form Zygarde. Serving as the protector of the planet's ecosystem, Zygarde is shown to be capable of gathering the energy of the land and focus it on its foes, damaging them. It has the ability to divide its cells from its body temporarily, using them as weapons, either as arrows or waves of energy. Zygarde has been referred to as a \"guardian of the ecosystem\"[1] due to its role to defend the world's order. In the Pokémon Adventures manga and Pokémon the Series, it has been referred to as \"Z\". Zygarde keeps a close watch on the planet and on its two counterparts, Xerneas and Yveltal, ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. Additionally, it is capable of reversing the effects of its counterparts' Abilities, Fairy Aura and Dark Aura. Normally, Zygarde avoids getting involved in conflicts unless the ecosystem is in grave danger.[2] Zygarde is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Land's Wrath, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Waves, and Core Enforcer. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Aura Break and Power Construct as its Abilities."
