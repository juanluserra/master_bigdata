    "descripcion": "Oinkologne is a quadrupedal Pokémon resembling a hog, with differing physiques between the male and the female. Generally speaking, Oinkologne has a large, stout build with a smooth, glossy coat. It has yellow growths underneath its eyes that resemble eyelashes, droopy triangular ears with yellow insides, a triangular snout, and a long, thin tail that curls counter-clockwise. It has well-developed leg muscles, which allow it to leap to a height of over 16 feet (5 meters). Both genders of Oinkologne have pink colorations on their eyelids, snouts, cloven hooves, and the tips of their tails, although the pink colorations on the male is more saturated than that of the female. The male also has a larger left ear and a shorter right ear, and vice versa for the female. The body of a male Oinkologne is entirely grayish black, with darker colorations on its face and ears. Its tail ends in a bulb or flower bud-like shape, which is able to unleash a concentrated sweet scent to cover its body, in order to attract female Pokémon. The male Oinkologne is the only known Pokémon that can have Lingering Aroma as an Ability. In contrast, female Oinkologne has a dark brownish coat with a lighter brown color on its face and ears, and its tail ends in three long appendages. Its body is surrounded by a floral aroma that calms nearby Pokémon. The female Oinkologne enjoys keeping things tidy, taking a meticulous approach to it."
