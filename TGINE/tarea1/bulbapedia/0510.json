    "descripcion": "Liepard is a slender, purple feline Pokémon  speckled with yellow rosettes. Its fur patterning is considered attractive to many Trainers. It has a pink \"mask\" marking over its eyes, a pink nose, and small yellow markings over its green eyes. It has two pairs of long yellow whiskers and a tufted yellow underside. Its lower legs are yellow, and each small paw has a pale pink pad that can be seen in Pokédex 3D Pro. It has a long, curving tail with a sickle-like shape toward the tip. Liepard has well-developed muscles that allows it to run silently and strike opponents from behind. It has also been known to vanish and reappear without warning. It is known to be rather moody and vicious. In Galar, it competes with Thievul for territory."
