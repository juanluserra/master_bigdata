    "descripcion": "Milcery is a small cream-colored Pok√©mon that resembles a splash of milk. It has a droplet-shaped body composed of cream, with two arms and a crown of six protrusions. These protrusions are made out of that same cream with droplets constantly jumping from them. It has completely white eyes. Milcery is born from sweet-smelling particles in the air. When a Milcery absorbs sweet aromas, its body begins to swell. Milcery will start to deflate when its energy level begins to drop. When Milcery is attacked, it will tackle the foe first before covering them in cream. Once the opponent is either blinded or astonished by delicious cream, Milcery will then flee. It is rumored that patisseries visited by Milcery are guaranteed success and good fortune. It is a female-only species."
