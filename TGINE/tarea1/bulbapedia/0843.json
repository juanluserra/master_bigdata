    "descripcion": "Silicobra is a Pokémon which resembles a small snake. Its body is mostly brownish white with a few darker spots, and its tail is curled at the tip. It has oval green eyes with black pupils, each one surrounded by a brown spot similar to a sand stain and a brown protuberant ridge above it. Paired with its crooked downward mouth, its face is similar to a frown. It also has two big nostrils. Silicobra has a dark yellow pouch around its neck, which it uses to store more than 17 pounds (8 kg) of sand. The pouch gets more elastic with every time Silicobra sheds its skin. Silicobra collects sand by swallowing it and shoots the sand from its nostrils, an ability it uses to blind predators so it can escape by burrowing into the ground. It also burrows into the sand in order to ambush its prey. Because Silicobra's nostrils are specialized for shooting out sand, it has a poor sense of smell. Silicobra and its evolution, Sandaconda, are the only known Pokémon that can have Sand Spit as an Ability."
