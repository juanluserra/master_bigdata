    "descripcion": "Tinkatuff is a pink humanoid Pok√©mon, with a large head and arms and short, stumpy toeless feet with light pink circles underneath. Its arms have three fingers each, and it has steel plates on its hips that resemble outturned pockets. Its head has light pink circles on its cheeks, silver eyes, and a mouth with square teeth-like growths on the upper and lower lips. It has thin eyebrows or eyelashes above its eyes that give it a perpetually angered expression. On top of its head is a white growth resembling hair tied into a ponytail, with a light pink zigzag pattern on the rim where the growth meets the head. Tinkatuff carries a large, gray, crude yet sturdy hammer, with loose metal plates for the hammer head and what appears to be the old hammer Tinkatuff had as a Tinkatink on top of the shaft. Tinkatuff makes its hammer using metal it collects from groups of Pawniard and Bisharp, which it preys on. Two Tinkatuff will smash their hammers together in order to test out the hammers' strength. Tinkatuff lives in homes made from piles of scrap metal. It is a female-only species. Tinkatuff largely resides in various ruins across Paldea."
