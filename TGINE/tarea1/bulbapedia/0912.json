    "pokemon": "Quaxly",
    "pokedex_number": "0912",
    "origin": "Quaxly appears to be based on a duckling of the crested duck or a South American crested duck. The crest itself resembles a beret, a turban, or a pompadour hairstyle. The crest might also be a visual pun on the hairstyle called the ducktail. The teal colorations on its feet and crest may be inspired by the blue-footed booby, or another visual pun on the teal (a type of duck). Its behaviour may also be based on hornpipe dancing.",
    "description": "Quaxly is a white duckling-like Pokémon. It has a yellow beak and blue eyes. It has teal webbed feet and a large teal coif-like crest that covers its head, with a feathery tuft in the front and a white curvy line shaped like a wave. Quaxly's coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. The cream it secretes can repel grime. The coif can become unkempt should it get dry.[1] Quaxly is an earnest and tidy Pokémon, and tends to overthink things. Quaxly's feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. Quaxly's strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents. It also uses its legs to repeatedly kick its foes with swift speed.[1] Although found in Paldea, Quaxly is not native to the region, instead having migrated from faraway places a long time ago. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, the coif on its head grows dry and messy should Quaxly sleep for a very long time. However, this tend to happen on extremely rare occasions."
