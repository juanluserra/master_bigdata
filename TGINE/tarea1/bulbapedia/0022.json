    "pokemon": "Fearow",
    "pokedex_number": "0022",
    "origin": "Fearow seems to be based on various predatory birds, particularly vultures and condors due to its long neck, sharp beak, shaggy feathers, broad wings, and soaring flight. The comb on its head is similar to a rooster's comb or a mohawk hairstyle. Its long neck and beak are also reminiscent of various water birds such as cormorants, darters, storks, and herons, particularly the Goliath heron. Its Pokédex entries describe multiple hunting methods, either divebombing prey like falcons and hawks or probing through soil and water like sandpipers and snipes.",
    "description": "Fearow is a large, mostly brown avian Pokémon with a vulturine neck and broad, powerful wings. It has a long, pointed, pink beak and a decorative red coxcomb on top of its head. Its narrow eyes have very small pupils and do not appear to have colored irises. It has shaggy feathers at the base of its neck and covering the upper portion of its wings. These feathers are cream-colored, as are the tips of its flight feathers. Its sharp-clawed talons are pink, with three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward. Fearow has been around mostly unchanged for many years, as a Pokémon resembling it has been seen on ancient murals. Its large wings and stamina allow it to fly for an entire day without landing. Its long neck and beak allow it to pluck prey from both land and water, and it has even been known to steal from unwary humans. It will shoot upward, and then dive down to catch prey. It will also catch tiny insects that hide underground and circle the ocean for fish. Fearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly wastelands and desolate fields."
