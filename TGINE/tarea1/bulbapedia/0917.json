    "pokemon": "Tarountula",
    "pokedex_number": "0917",
    "origin": "Tarountula may be based on the orb-weaver spider alongside members of the Uloboridae family, which are non-venomous and wrap their prey in bundles of silk. Its silk-covered abdomen evokes a yarn ball and may serve as a literal take on an \"orb-weaver\", although it may also be based on the spherical pods that Deinopis spiders create to shelter their eggs — especially as its evolution Spidops appears to be primarily based on these spiders. Tarountula's Shiny coloration resembles the Destiny Knot.",
    "description": "Tarountula is a lime-green arachnid Pokémon whose body is wrapped in a ball of white threads that it secretes from its rear. Its face has white patterns that flank its two eyes on either side, as well as two pairs of protrusions resembling chelicerae and pedipalps, which hides a tiny mouth on the bottom of its head. It has eight spindly legs tipped with a dark green color on the ends. Its abdomen can be seen when it willingly ejects its ball of white threads. Tarountula can sometimes be found hanging upside down from trees using its thread. Tarountula's thread is elastic and strong as wire, being able to deflect even the attacks of its natural enemy, Scyther. Research into the secret behind the thread's strength is currently ongoing."
