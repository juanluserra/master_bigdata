    "descripcion": "Dewpider is a Pokémon resembling a spider with a water bubble over its head. Its head and most of its abdomen are dark gray, while its thorax and six legs are light green. All of its legs are thin with a knobby joint in the middle, and three of its legs are typically used to anchor the bubble on its head. Sometimes Dewpider will secretly swap which legs will hold up the bubble. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings. Several triangular flaps extend upward and attach to the bubble over its head. The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and a light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which the anime  has shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles. Dewpider can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over their head allows them to breathe on land. Dewpider uses the sticky silk it creates to form a sturdy water bubble that will rarely burst. Additionally, the bubble protects its soft head and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two Dewpider meet, they compare bubbles and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way.  It supports the water bubble that envelops its head with three of its legs. Dewpider and its evolved form, Araquanid, are the only known Pokémon that can have Water Bubble as an Ability."
