    "descripcion": "Coalossal is a Pok√©mon which resembles a massive goliath with a body of coal. It has a large, coal-black body, with two legs and a pair of stubby arms, alongside two massive spikes atop its shoulders. It bears a head consisting of a pair of white eyes that can glow red and a mouth with serrated teeth. It carries a large amount of heated coal on its back. Despite its large and tough look, Coalossal has a peaceful disposition. However, it becomes enraged if the coal mines it lives in are vandalized, incinerating those who invade its territory with flames as hot as 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius). In battle, the coal on its head will burn bright red and radiate heat that sends sparks flying, scorching its surroundings. Coalossal intimidates its opponents by shaking its body and loosing coal from its back."
