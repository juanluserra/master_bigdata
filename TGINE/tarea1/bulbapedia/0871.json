    "pokemon": "Pincurchin",
    "pokedex_number": "0871",
    "origin": "Pincurchin appears to be based on a sea urchin, especially the burrowing urchin. Its behavior may reference the ability that some sea urchins have to inject venom using their spines as a defense mechanism, although in Pincurchin's case, its spines emit electricity instead. Its yellow mouthparts (orange in its Shiny coloration) may be a reference to sea urchin roe, which is often yellow or orange in color and is considered a delicacy. Pincurchin may also draw some inspiration from pincushions.",
    "description": "Pincurchin is a marine, sea urchin-like Pokémon with a black body. Its face has two yellow eyes with black, triangle-shaped pupils on each of them, and two yellow circular mouthparts. A line of sharp spines runs down its back, along with two other lines of two spines each on the side of its body. Each spine has a grayish tip which glows yellow when electric current runs through it. Pincurchin has five hard teeth, which it uses to feed on seaweed by scraping them off rocks and other surfaces. As its food digests, Pincurchin generates electricity, which it stores in its spines. If one of the spines gets broken off, it will continue to emit electricity for approximately three hours. Pincurchin's yellow mouthparts, in contrast, do not conduct electricity. Pincurchin has a timid and easily frightened disposition and will discharge electricity when startled. This serves well as protection against its natural predator Mareanie. In Generation IX, Zing Zap is its signature move. Additionally, in Generation IX, Pincurchin is the only known Pokémon that can have Electric Surge as an Ability."
