    "descripcion": "Arctozolt is a hybrid fossil Pokémon. It has a light-blue body with a snow-like patch on the top. Its body has blue fins with white patches on the ends and some spots. It has a plesiosaur-like tail with a fin on top. It has two yellow hands. Arctozolt has a paravian-like head with closed eyes and a blue spot on each cheek. It produces mucus from its nose. By shaking its freezing upper half, Arctozolt can generate electricity. It was known to live on ancient shores and preserved its food with the ice on its body. It allegedly went extinct because it moved very slowly, but this is likely not the case due to Arctozolt being combined from two separate Pokémon that each had their niches before going extinct."
