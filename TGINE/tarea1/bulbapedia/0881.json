    "pokemon": "Arctozolt",
    "pokedex_number": "0881",
    "origin": "Arctozolt, like Dracozolt, Dracovish, and Arctovish, may be based on the concept of chimera in paleontology, which refers to fossils reconstructed from multiple different species or genus of animals, resulting in an inaccurate and mistaken understanding of the animals' biology. In the case of Arctozolt, its top half appears to be based on a dromaeosaurid, while its bottom half appears to be based on a marine reptile, like a plesiosaur, mosasaur, or ichthyosaur. Arctozolt and the other Galarian Fossil Pokémon may also be based on the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, a series of scientifically inaccurate dinosaur sculptures displayed at the Crystal Palace Park. Arctozolt may particularly reference the Ichthyosaurus statue included in the series. The mucus it possesses is likely inspired by the fact that cold weather often results in a runny nose.",
    "description": "Arctozolt is a hybrid fossil Pokémon. It has a light-blue body with a snow-like patch on the top. Its body has blue fins with white patches on the ends and some spots. It has a plesiosaur-like tail with a fin on top. It has two yellow hands. Arctozolt has a paravian-like head with closed eyes and a blue spot on each cheek. It produces mucus from its nose. By shaking its freezing upper half, Arctozolt can generate electricity. It was known to live on ancient shores and preserved its food with the ice on its body. It allegedly went extinct because it moved very slowly, but this is likely not the case due to Arctozolt being combined from two separate Pokémon that each had their niches before going extinct."
