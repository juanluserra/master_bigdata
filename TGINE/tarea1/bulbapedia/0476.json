    "descripcion": "Probopass is a mostly blue, rock-like Pokémon. It has small round eyes, a red nose that is large in proportion to its body, and a bushy black mustache that consists of iron sand, which appears to be attracted by its magnetic nose. Probopass has three small objects on its sides and back, called Mini-Noses (Japanese: チビノーズ Chibinose), which it is able to control. It has a big red hat-like magnet on top of its head, and exudes strong magnetism from all over its body. Being able to command these Mini-Noses, Probopass is able to catch prey and attack opponents from all three directions. On occasion, its Mini-Noses can get lost and may never come back. It emits strong magnetic fields that enable it to levitate, and can damage nearby appliances. Probopass can use the iron sand to form rocks, which it uses to destroy its prey. It is rarely seen in the wild, but may be found in mountainous regions very occasionally."
