    "descripcion": "Grimmsnarl is a green-skinned humanoid Pokémon mostly covered in long, dark purple hair, except for part of its face, its abdomen, its feet, and a small red patch on its chest. Most of its hair wraps around its body, except for a lock on each side of its face, a few spikes raised on its shoulders and some locks draping from behind its legs resembling a cape. While being bulkier than its pre-Evolutions, Grimmsnarl is more slender than it appears to be, with its hair giving the appearance of a muscular body. Grimmsnarl's hair works like muscle fibers and helps enhance its strength. Grimmsnarl is able to move its hair, and uses them to ensnare opponents in a tentacle-like fashion. By using its hair in this way, Grimmsnarl is powerful enough to overwhelm Machamp. Like its pre-Evolutions, Grimmsnarl has tall, large crescent-shaped ears with red insides, as well as a long, sharp, upturned nose with a single long red nostril. It has a blue tongue and six teeth protruding from its mouth: two pairs of flat front teeth on each jaw, and a pair of sharp fangs on the upper jaw. It has white eyes with red irises, black pupils, and gray eyelids. Its face ends in a small pointy chin. Grimmsnarl's hands and feet have three pointed digits each. Grimmsnarl and its pre-Evolutions are male-only species. It lives in the forests, and retains the troublemaking behavior of its pre-evolved forms. Grimmsnarl and its pre-evolved form, Morgrem, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move False Surrender. In Generation IX, Confide is also one of its signature moves. In Generation VIII, this was also true for Spirit Break."
