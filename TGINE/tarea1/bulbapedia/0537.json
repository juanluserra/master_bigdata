    "descripcion": "Seismitoad is a bulky, aquamarine-blue, bipedal toad-like Pok√©mon. Its underside and the bumps found on various parts of its body are cyan with thick black edges. Its hands and feet have three bulbous digits. Additionally, Seismitoad has red eyes, cyan adornments on its legs, and a long tongue. The various lumps on its body have varying capabilities. The ones on its head can shoot a paralyzing liquid, while the ones on its hands can be vibrated to increase its punching power. It can also vibrate the lumps as a source of torment for its opponents, or use them to create earthquake-like tremors. Seismitoad is popular among the elderly, who use the lumps' vibrations for massages. Seismitoad is known to wield venom, and is related to Croagunk and Toxicroak."
