    "pokemon": "Seismitoad",
    "pokedex_number": "0537",
    "origin": "According to interviews with Ken Sugimori in Nintendo Dream, Seismitoad is based on a Japanese common toad. Although the team had previously created Pokémon based on frogs with the Poliwag line, Sugimori wished to go for a more \"traditional frog-like evolution\" in this instance.[1] The lumps on its body may be inspired by the \"warts\" found on most toads (known as parotoid glands), combined with loudspeaker drivers. This connection between frogs and loudspeakers may stem from the croaking behavior seen with male frogs, which do so to attract mates. Inspiration may also come from the common Surinam toad, an aquatic amphibian whose back is covered in pockets that hold its eggs.",
    "description": "Seismitoad is a bulky, aquamarine-blue, bipedal toad-like Pokémon. Its underside and the bumps found on various parts of its body are cyan with thick black edges. Its hands and feet have three bulbous digits. Additionally, Seismitoad has red eyes, cyan adornments on its legs, and a long tongue. The various lumps on its body have varying capabilities. The ones on its head can shoot a paralyzing liquid, while the ones on its hands can be vibrated to increase its punching power. It can also vibrate the lumps as a source of torment for its opponents, or use them to create earthquake-like tremors. Seismitoad is popular among the elderly, who use the lumps' vibrations for massages. Seismitoad is known to wield venom, and is related to Croagunk and Toxicroak."
