    "descripcion": "Mesprit is a small, gray, fairy-like Pokémon. It has two tails that each have a red jewel encrusted in them. Mesprit has a partially magenta face with four long, drooping appendages and another red gem encrusted in its forehead. Mesprit's spirit can leave its body without dying and return to the body at will. Legends say that a person that touches it will have their emotions completely drained away. Mesprit was highly feared due to it punishing those who disrespect it; Mesprit will throw their emotions into disarray. Mesprit is said to have taught humans the ability to feel sorrow, pain, and joy. It was shown in The Needs of the Three! and The Battle Finale of Legend! that it can teleport itself, as well as other Pokémon and humans. Though playful, it is a bit mischievous. In the past, it has been referred to as the \"Being of Emotion\" due to its role in giving humans the ability to feel happiness and sadness present in life. Alongside the other lake guardians, Mesprit is needed for the creation of a Red Chain. Either through gems extracted from its body or through its plume. Together they're also capable of destroying a Red Chain. They even have the power to calm down Dialga and Palkia should the deities be enraged, but not both at once. Mesprit lives in Lake Verity, specifically in the Verity Cavern at the center of the lake, thus gaining the title Lake Guardian. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Mesprit is shown to be capable of speaking the human language via telepathy. . Mesprit and the other lake guardians are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Mystical Power."
