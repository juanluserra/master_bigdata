    "descripcion": "Salandit is a small, black Pokémon resembling a salamander or lizard. Its body is dark gray with a black head and feet. Along its back and down its tail is an orange-red line. This marking splits into four short lines with round tips at the base of its tail. At the base of its neck are two short, flat spines, which create the impression of a mask or bandanna tied around its head. Its eyes are light purple with slit pupils and there are several tooth-like protrusions along its upper jaw. Each foot has four pointed toes. Salandit is found around volcanoes or arid, rocky environments. From the marking at the base of its tail, it can emit both toxic gas and flames. The gas is created by burning body fluids and has a sweet odor that causes dizziness. However, Bug Pokémon are attracted to the scent and are common prey. The female can also release pheromones that attract males of all species, including humans.[1] Additionally, these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by this Pokémon's will. Because of this, male Salandit offers its food to females, leaving it malnourished and unable to evolve. While it is not a powerful Pokémon, it is able to unbalance opponents with its cunning techniques. It does have difficulty with Spinda, since that Pokémon is already off balance. Prior to Generation IX, Salandit and its evolved form, Salazzle, were the only known Pokémon that could have Corrosion as an Ability."
