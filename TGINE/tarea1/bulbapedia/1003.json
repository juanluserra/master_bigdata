    "descripcion": "Ting-Lu is a large Pokémon resembling a cloven-hoofed mammal such as a deer or a moose. Its body is composed of layered rock, ranging in color from dark brown to a light tan. Its shoulders are humped. Its head has several red markings, as well as small red eyes and what appears to be a dewlap on its chin. Upon its head is a large ritual vessel cracked down the middle, with an ornate rectangular pattern resembling eyes at the front, and several antler-like spikes jutting out from the rim. Like the other treasures of ruin, Ting-Lu's true form is that of the ritual vessel on its head, having been given life by the fear of humans from ancient times — while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over the earth. Ting-Lu is described as being able to create fissures over 160 feet (50 meters) deep just by slowly putting down its head on the ground. It is known as the Vessel of Ruin. Ting-Lu and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ruination. Ting-Lu is also the only known Pokémon that can have Vessel of Ruin as an Ability."
