    "descripcion": "Cursola is a coral-like Pokémon. The lower body of Cursola resembles that of Galarian Corsola, albeit broken apart to reveal an ectoplasmic \"body\" which has taken the shape of a ghost. This ectoplasm surrounds Cursola's core, which is a white sphere with a face like that of Galarian Corsola, and has an oval-shaped opening with three inward-facing notches where the core is. Two half-circle openings similar to eyes are located above Cursola's core. Together, the three openings resemble a screaming face with a sad or pained expression. On its ectoplasmic body, two small branches below the core serve as its arms and one small branch on its forehead serves as a horn. It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks. Cursola's overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown — one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the Cursola.[1] Cursola is the only known Pokémon that can have Perish Body as an Ability."
