    "descripcion": "Crabrawler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Most of its shell is purple with blue and yellow accents. It has two long, yellow antennae over its eyes. One blue eyelid is usually half-closed, giving it the appearance of a black eye. The purple shell covering its body appears to be made of three parts: two plain plates covering the shoulders and part of the chest and one plate covered in blue stripes across its underside. A large portion of its yellow body is visible down the center of its chest and a tiny spot is visible in the center of its back. Crabrawler has three pairs of legs. The two rear pairs are smaller with yellow joints and blue tips. The foremost pair of legs has large blue pincers resembling boxing gloves. There is a small amount of meat in its claws, which is considered delicious. A competitive Pokémon that hates to lose, this Pokémon uses its large claws to protect its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse but grow back quickly. Crabrawler's pincers are a popular ingredient for paella, making a tasty soup stock. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints. While it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries.[1] Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute. It has been known to mistake Exeggutor for coconut trees, which shake and stomp Crabrawler off when climbed. Crabrawler are known to cimb snowy mountains in order to reach the top. However, they tend to get lost and trapped up there. As a result, Crabrawler evovles into Crabominable in order to better adapt to the bitter cold.[2]"
