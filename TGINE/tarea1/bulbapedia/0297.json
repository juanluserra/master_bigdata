    "descripcion": "Hariyama is a large, bulky humanoid Pokémon that is modeled after a sumo wrestler. It has narrow eyes and rounded ears. On its head is a short, triangular crest. Dark blue hair grows across the tops of its eyes, around the head crest, and extends down its back to form a long ponytail. The upper half of its body is cream-colored, while the lower half is dark blue. Yellow extensions encircle its waist, resembling a skirt. There is a small, orange half-circle marking in the center of its torso just above the skirt. Hariyama has large hands with three fingers and small, two-toed feet. Both its hands and feet are orange. Hariyama's body consists mostly of muscle instead of fat. When its body tenses, its muscles become as hard as stone. It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pokémon and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful slapping arms. They are kindhearted and practice etiquette, praising its battle opponents. As it grows older, it focuses more on training Makuhita. It lives in mountainous areas. Iron Hands bear a resemblance to Hariyama. Hariyama and its pre-evolved form, Makuhita, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Smelling Salts by leveling up. Prior to Generation V, Arm Thrust was also one of its signature moves."
