    "description": "Carnivine is a green plant-like Pok√©mon resembling a Venus flytrap. Its circular eyes have small pupils, and it has spiky teeth. Its stem is yellow with green spots, with red and green vines beneath with the appearance of tentacles. It has two arms resembling leaves with three leafy 'fingers' each. Carnivine is very gluttonous, and is known to have an unruly temper. It is capable of hanging from tree branches using its vines, while its mouth can open to about 180 degrees wide. With its mouth wide open, Carnivine attracts the prey it waits for with sweet-smelling saliva, then chomps down. However, it takes a whole day to eat prey. Carnivine's diet consists mostly of insects and small bugs. It lives in forests and marshes."
