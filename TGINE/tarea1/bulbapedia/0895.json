    "descripcion": "Regidrago is a spherical, golem-like Pokémon. It has a dark red body made of crystallized dragon energy, with the energy being the densest at its central core. Its face has a pattern of seven blue dots that resembles the capital letter \"Y\". It has two red legs with black feet that are shaped like teeth. Its arms are black on the outside and dark red on the inside, and resemble a dragon's head; the right arm resembles a dragon's upper jaw, complete with horns and \"eye sockets\", while the left arm is shaped like a lower jaw. Two red spikes shaped like wings are located behind its back, although it doesn't use these to fly, as it is capable of floating in the air. Regidrago's body and the \"eye sockets\" on its right arm can glow pink when attacking. According to legend, Regidrago was created by the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas using crystallized dragon energy. It used to be worshipped by humans, however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away in the Split-Decision Ruins. Regigigas ran out of crystals after building Regidrago's head and it was sealed away by ancient people, who feared the destruction it would cause should it ever be completed.[1] Due to its body composition, Regidrago is said to have the most powerful Dragon-type moves of all Pokémon,[1] along with the power of every Dragon-type Pokémon. Regidrago can fire an attack made of intense dragon energy by combining its arms to form a mouth[1]. There is an unproven academic theory that posits that Regidrago's arms originated from the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. It can convert its life-force into power, attacking its opposers. Regidrago is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Dragon Energy. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Dragon's Maw as an Ability."
