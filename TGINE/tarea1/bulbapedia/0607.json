    "descripcion": "Litwick is a small, candle-like Pokémon with a purple flame atop its head, which is powered by life energy that it absorbs. Its body and two stubby arms are made primarily out of white wax. The folded, melted wax lays over its right eye and leaves only the bright yellow left eye visible. It has a small smile under a protruding upper lip. Litwick pretends to guide people and Pokémon around by illuminating darkened areas. However, it is sucking away their life energy and leading them to the Ghost World. In the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Scare at the Litwick Mansion!, the flame is shown to grow as it continually absorbs life energy and interferes with electronic devices such as Pokédexes."
