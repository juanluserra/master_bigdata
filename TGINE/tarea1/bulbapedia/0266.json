    "descripcion": "Silcoon is a cocoon-like Pok√©mon that uses silk to attach itself to tree branches. It is almost completely covered in white silk with only two small holes. A pair of red eyes can be seen through the holes, but they are partially hidden by a rough fringe of silk. The silk forms a hard cocoon that it can use to repel enemy attacks. Dew and rainwater collect on the silk, which provides Silcoon with nourishment. Silcoon lives in forests, where it conserves energy by moving as little as possible. This energy, which it had gathered as a Wurmple, serves as fuel for its further Evolution. Due to its cocoon, Silcoon cannot extend its limbs and can only move really slowly. However, its eyes allow it to be on the lookout for danger."
