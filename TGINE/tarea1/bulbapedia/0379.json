Most of Registeel's body is spherical and gray while the middle of its face has the appearance of being exposed as it shows black \"skin\" and is surrounded by raised metal. Registeel's lower half is disc-like in shape and has two cylindrical legs without toes. Its face consists of seven red dots in a hexagonal formation, and it has black arms with three fingers each that are connected to its upper half by gray hemispherical shoulders. The backs of its hands have three red triangles pointing away from the fingers. According to legend, Registeel was created by the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas using magma. It used to be worshipped by humans, however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away. In Hoenn, it was sealed in the Ancient Tomb; in Sinnoh, it was sealed in the Iron Ruins; and in Galar, it was sealed in the Iron Ruins. its body is hollow and made of a material that is harder than any known metal. However, this material stretches and shrinks despite its hardness. The metal composing its body is thought to be a curious substance that not of this earth. Tempered by pressure underground over tens of thousands of years, its body cannot be scratched. It is also rumored that Registeel was born deep underground in the planet's mantle and that it emerged onto the surface 10,000 years ago. It is unknown what it can eat."
