    "descripcion": "Vivillon is a butterfly-like Pokémon with wings that come in a large variety of patterns. It has a round, grayish head with large, black, pixelated eyes and a pair of skinny antennae. The tips of the antennae each have an ovoid scale that is dark gray on the upper half and beige on the lower half. Vivillon's thorax is an ovoid and divided into three segments; each segment is a different shade of gray. Its legs are also ovoid and are dark gray on the lower half, beige on the upper half, and have a black band in the middle. It has two black, circular hands and no visible arms. While Vivillon's wings come in a wide variety of colors and patterns, they always have black edges and pixelated markings. It can spread its scales to poison its opponents during battle or, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: XY episode To Catch a Pokémon Smuggler!, to calm an opponent's fighting spirit. It is highly capable of finding sources of water, such as springs. Vivillon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Powder by leveling up."
