    "pokemon": "Petilil",

    "origin": "Petilil appears to be based on the bulb of a Liliaceae plant, most likely a tulip. Its Shiny coloration may be based on yellow onion or golden garlic bulbs.",
    "description": "Petilil is a plant Pokémon that resembles a plant bulb, such as an onion. It is primarily light green. Its head is tipped with three oblong leaves, whose color can determine how healthy the Petilil is. The leaves on its head reliably grow back if any fall off, and if they are pruned regularly, Petilil can be grown into a fine round shape. Its crescent-shaped white face, seemingly lacking a nose or mouth, has brown eyes shaped like elongated ovals. A green \"bib\" is present on its neck, and its lower body consists of five stubs. The outer stubs act as arms, the middle stub acts as a foot, and the two inner stubs next to it are used to move itself around. The leaves on Petilil's head are very bitter, which can cause dizziness. However, these leaves possess revitalizing effects such as restoring a person's vigor. This can be achieved by eating the leaves directly, or drying and boiling them into an infusion. This infusion is also sometimes used as a bug repellent. Because of the health effects of its leaves, Petilil is very popular with the elderly. Petilil tends to appear near sources of clean waters. It lives in areas with soil abundant in moisture and nutrients. The homes can be either well-tended fields or flowerbeds. However, they will leave if the environment turns bad. This Pokémon is a female-only species with no male counterpart. In Hisui, the snowy mountainous landscape causes Petilil to gain the Fighting-type when it evolves into Lilligant."
