    "descripcion": "Typhlosion is a bulky mammalian Pokémon with a long, yet agile body. It is classified as a quadruped, but it is capable of bipedal movement. Most of its body is cream-colored, but its back and the top of its head are a dark green-blue. It has a short, rounded snout and small, triangular eyes and ears. When its mouth is open, its sharp canine teeth and thick tongue are visible. Each of its paws has five digits and there is a coarse, spiky fringe of fur along its rear. Across the back of its neck, several red spots can produce fire. Typhlosion is capable of making anything go up in flames when angered and creating explosions by rubbing its fur together. The heat it generates when ready for battle creates a shimmering haze that can also be used to hide itself. When fully enraged, anything Typhlosion touches instantly goes up in flames. Though it is rare in the wild, it can be found living on grasslands. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Typhlosion is known to toss and turn while sleeping.[1] It is recommended to avoid a sleeping Typhlosion due to it unleashing blasts fires from its back by accident."
