    "descripcion": "Pyroar is a quadrupedal, leonine Pokémon. It is mostly dark brown with light brown legs, tail tip, chest, and face. It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, round ears with dark brown interiors, bright blue eyes, and a dark brown stripe behind each eye. The fur around its thighs is longer and each paw has three toes. There is a tuft of longer fur on the tip of its tail. A male Pyroar has a large, predominantly red mane with gold streaks forming a pattern resembling the Daimonji symbol (大) and the symbol for fire (火). In contrast, a female has a long, gold and red crest-like mane extending from its forehead. Female Pyroar significantly outnumber their male counterparts. The female's mane is as long as its whole body, and the light brown on its front legs extends all the way to its shoulders. The light brown fur on the male's front legs only extends up to its elbows. Like real-life lions, Pyroar live in prides, which are led by the male with the largest mane. The pride's females protect the Litleo cubs and teach them how to hunt. The females also work together to bring down prey, ensuring the pride never goes hungry. A male Pyroar is usually lazy, but will protect its friends at the risk of its own well-being. In battle, the male Pyroar's mane can heat up to over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), which can cause severe burns when approached. Pyroar viciously threatens any challenger with a fiery breath exceeding 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). However, it prefers its meat raw and does not use its breath on its prey. Pyroar typically lives in grassy plains and mountainsides. Prior to Generation VII, Pyroar and its pre-evolved form, Litleo, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Noble Roar."
