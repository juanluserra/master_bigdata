    "descripcion": "Arctovish is a fish-plesiosaur hybrid fossil Pokémon. The plesiosaur half is colored blue and white. Arctovish has a blue tail with a fin on top. The flippers are colored blue with white patches on the end and with white spots. The fish half is applied upside down. It has a round blue head with black rectangle pupils, and the mouth is located on top of its head. It has white fins connected to its fish head. It has trouble eating due to its mouth being on top of its head, even though it captures prey by freezing its surroundings. The skin on Arctovish's face is impervious to attacks. It allegedly became extinct despite this due to breathing difficulties, though this is likely not the case due to Arctovish being combined from two separate Pokémon that each had their niches before going extinct."
