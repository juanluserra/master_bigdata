    "descripcion": "Gible is a small, bipedal dragon-like Pokémon that is primarily grayish-blue. It has a big mouth filled with sharp teeth, no neck, and arms that start at the outer edges of its jaws. Its stomach is relatively small compared to its mouth. A red underbelly stretches from its abdomen to the bottom of its jaw. Gible has two horns that resemble jet or plane engines, each with a light blue stripe in the middle. It has a single light blue stripe wrapping around its back, and a short tail. On top of its head is a dorsal fin, which has a notch on it for the male. Its dorsal fin is strong enough to carry a person. In the past, Gible lived in the tropics. Gible appears to be a good digger, making deep holes for homes in caverns warmed by geothermal heat. This heated environment allows Gible to survive even during the winter. It has also been seen huddling with other members of its species to stave off the cold, although it enjoys play-fighting with them as well. Gible is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains. Gible has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest. However, even while biting, it often hurts itself because of clumsiness. This sometimes causes its teeth to chip and fall off in the process, but Gible is never bothered by this because the teeth will grow back after a few days. As shown in the animated series, Gible is capable of eating through most types of metal. In Generation IX, Gible and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability."
