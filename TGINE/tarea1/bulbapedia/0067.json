    "descripcion": "Machoke is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon covered in blue-gray skin (purple prior to Generation VI). It has a vaguely reptilian face with a short snout, narrow red eyes, and four pointed teeth visible inside its mouth. Two of these teeth are in the upper jaw, while two are in the lower jaw. On top of its head are three brown ridges. Its arms are muscular with dark red, vertical stripes on them. The lower part of its body has black markings that resemble briefs.[1] It is always seen wearing a black and gold power-save belt resembling a championship belt. It possesses large pectoral muscles that protrude slightly over its belt. Machoke is a Pokémon of immense strength. Its muscles are as hard as steel, and it is capable of lifting extremely heavy objects with only one finger. Machoke's body is powerful enough to never get tired. Machoke is a popular Pokémon used as a motif for sculptures. In spite of this, it is modest and often helps people with manual labor. The belt it wears regulates its strength, but Machoke removes it when facing a truly powerful opponent. It can be found in the mountains, where it trains daily. In Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move."
