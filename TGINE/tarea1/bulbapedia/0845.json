    "descripcion": "Cramorant is a blue avian Pokémon resembling a cormorant. It has bright green, large, circular eyes with small black pupils, and a large, thin yellow beak. It has a ruff of light gray feathers that goes around its torso and sticks out at the back, making it resemble a bib. It has a ruff of feathers on its head, with the largest clump pointing backward and being surrounded by small singular feathers. Its feet are black, webbed, and have three toes. Its wings seem to be perpetually spread outwards on its sides. Its tail feathers appear asymmetrical, with a slit between them on one side. Cramorant is a gluttonous Pokémon with an instinctive desire to swallow anything whole. It generally hunts for prey along riverbanks. Its preferred prey is Arrokuda, but sometimes it tries to swallow other Pokémon such as Pikachu, attempting to spit them out if it realizes its mistake.[1] As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Cramorant is known to occasionally sleep while still swallowing its prey. The reason for this behavior is unknown to everyone, including the Cramorant itself. Cramorant is quite strong, to the point where it can knock out some opponents in one hit. However, it is also rather unintelligent, forgetful, and bad at learning, as the energy used by its brain is minimal. It tends to focus more on battling, but sometimes it can't remember what it is battling mid-fight. Despite this forgetfulness, Cramorant never forgets Trainers that it trusts. However, it will try to attack its Trainer if they try to steal its food.[1] Cramorant is the only known Pokémon that can have Gulp Missile as its Ability."
