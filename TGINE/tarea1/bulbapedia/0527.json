    "pokemon": "Woobat",
    "pokedex_number": "0527",
    "origin": "With its light-colored fur, prominent nose and fluffy, round bodies, Woobat appears to be based on Honduran white bats. In particular, their shape resembles how these bats look when they're curled up together. Sunlight filters through the leaves these bats sleep on and make their white fur appear green during the day, which would mirror Woobat's Shiny form.",
    "description": "Woobat is a blue, spherical Pokémon, resembling a Honduran White Bat. It is covered in shaggy fur and has a large, piggish nose with a heart-shaped nostril. Two tufts of shaggy fur hide its eyes, and its mouth has a single fang in the center of its upper jaw. There are two relatively small, black wings on either side of its body. Woobat's nose serves various purposes: It uses ultrasonic waves from its nostrils for echolocation, and it can also be used to grip walls as Woobat sleeps, which leaves heart-shaped marks on the walls of caves. A Woobat's heart-shaped mark is said to give good fortune to whoever it leaves its mark on. Woobat preys on bug Pokémon and is known to live in caves and dark forests."
