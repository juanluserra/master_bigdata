    "descripcion": "Jigglypuff is a pink Pokémon with a spherical body. It has pointed ears with black insides and large, blue eyes. It has small, stubby arms and slightly longer feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. Its body is filled with air, and, as seen in Pokémon Stadium, Jigglypuff can deflate until it is flat. It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros. Jigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pokémon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and it sounds like shouting in some areas. Jigglypuff is mostly found in lush green plains and grassy meadows. Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Jigglypuff is known to sing even when sleeping.[1]"
