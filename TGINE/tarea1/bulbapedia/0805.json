    "pokemon": "Stakataka",
    "pokedex_number": "0805",
    "origin": "Stakataka resembles a castle tower. It may take inspiration from Mokumokuren, a species of yōkai known for living in walls and is distinctly identified by its myriad of eyes; and Nurikabe, a yōkai known for blocking the way of travelers in the guise of a wall.",
    "description": "Stakataka is an Ultra Beast composed of many dark gray, stone lifeforms stacked together to form a four-sided tower with a spindly leg on each corner. The stones that form the legs and the top corners are slightly darker. When at rest, its legs fit into the corners of the structure. Its lighter gray stones have glowing blue lines on their sides, which are visible along its edges and underside. Each stone square has a black underside with a circular, glowing blue eye in the center. These eyes will turn red whenever angered or fighting.[1] According to Phyco, a single Stakataka comprises almost 150 individual lifeforms. Stakataka can plant itself on the ground to disguise itself or when sleeping. It can freely manipulate the stone lifeforms on its body to form legs and open up to let attacks through or trap foes inside it. Stakataka's legs are strong enough to break a tree in half. Like all Ultra Beasts, Stakataka stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura[2]. As seen in The Long Vault Home!, Stakataka hates having anything on top of itself and will violently try to shake the object off. However, if someone can resist the shaking and successfully ride it, then it will calm down and they'll gain Stakataka's respect. Like Blacephalon, Stakataka's homeworld is one of the only worlds which is not seen and cannot be visited riding Solgaleo or Lunala in a Ultra Warp Ride."
