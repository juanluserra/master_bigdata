    "pokemon": "Riolu",
    "pokedex_number": "0447",
    "origin": "Riolu appears to be based on the Egyptian god Anubis, who has the head of an African golden wolf. It may also be based on a raccoon or tanuki, due to the mask-like markings on its face and its small pointed ears.",
    "description": "Riolu is a small, blue, canine Pokémon. It has a black torso and legs, a blue tail, and a yellow collar. It has rounded bumps on the backs of its forepaws. It has a black \"mask\" and red eyes. It stands on its toes instead of its entire foot. It is sensitive to a special type of energy called Aura; however, it does not have the ability to fully use these powers, although it can still emanate these waves to communicate and sense them, albeit only in ripples. It has developed two black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Riolu reads or manipulates aura. It has even been seen that Riolu can sense and react to Aura before they even hatch. The aura emitting from Riolu's body grows even stronger when it is frightened or sad. Like most Fighting-type Pokémon, Riolu naturally has superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. It is capable of making long journeys on foot in a short amount of time. It is a playful, energetic, and loyal Pokémon. It is also known to be tough and hard working. Riolu will read the minds of humans to assure whether or not they are pure of heart. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Riolu tends to sleep in a unsual position. This position is sitting up while not lying down, similar to Lucario. It is believed that Riolu is pushing itself hard and dreaming of the day it evolves into Lucario."
