    "descripcion": "Swoobat is a blue, bat-like Pokémon. It has fused, pointed ears with striated, lighter-colored insides and a pink, heart-shaped snout with a single nostril. Two wide, rounded teeth are visible in its lower jaw. A mane of shaggy, light blue fur surrounds its neck. Its black wings have a claw at the joint, and its small black feet have three toes each. It has a bare, pink tail that is twisted with two short prongs at the tip. Swoobat's nose can produce many different ultrasonic waves. Its nose is also considered to be a symbol of good luck in certain regions. When Swoobat shakes its tail vigorously, it produces sound waves powerful enough to destroy concrete. A male Swoobat produces waves during courtship that uplifts anyone who hears it. However, emitting these powerful sound waves can leave Swoobat exhausted, rendering it unable to fly for a short period of time. In the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode The Four Seasons of Sawsbuck!, Swoobat is shown to hang from its tail as it sleeps."
