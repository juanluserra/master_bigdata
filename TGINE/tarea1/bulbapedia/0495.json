    "descripcion": "Snivy is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a slender build. Most of its body is green with a cream underside. A yellow stripe runs down the length of its back and tail and has yellow markings around its large eyes. Two curved yellow structures that resemble leaves or small wings protrude from its shoulders and bend backward. Its slender arms have three fingers, while its tiny feet have no digits. It has a large, palmate leaf with three prongs on the end of its tail. This tail can perform photosynthesis, allowing Snivy to move more quickly and adding an edge to its moves. However, the tail will begin to droop when Snivy loses energy. Snivy can use its vines with incredible adaptive and dexterity skills, to make up for having short arms. This Pokémon has a calm, collected demeanor and is very intelligent. Snivy prefers to be alone and avoid groups whenever it can. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."
