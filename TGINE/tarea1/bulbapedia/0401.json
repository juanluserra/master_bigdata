    "pokemon": "Kricketot",
    "pokedex_number": "0401",
    "origin": "Kricketot appears to be based on a cricket, who are known widely for their loud chirping songs used to attract females. It also bears the semblance of a real musician; possibly a music conductor or member of an orchestra. Its body works as a living musical instrument: its abdomen resembles one of many stringed instruments, such as a violin or lyre, and its antennae can make a sound similar to a xylophone or marimba.",
    "description": "Kricketot is a bipedal, bug-like Pokémon. The majority of its body is red with a pale yellow streak down its front and a black cape-like marking on its back. Its head is encircled with a flat, pale yellow structure similar to a collar. A female has a bigger collar than a male. Two hard, black antennae with curled tips are connected to the head by a dark red segment. A similar dark red segment forms this Pokémon's nose, and it has small, black hands and feet. Kricketot are known to stumble sometimes due to their short legs. By shaking its head and rubbing its antennae together, Kricketot is able to create a sound similar to a xylophone or marimba that it uses to communicate with others of its kind. Kricketot are known to gather in greater numbers during autumn nights."
