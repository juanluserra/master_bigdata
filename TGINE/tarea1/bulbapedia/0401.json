    "descripcion": "Kricketot is a bipedal, bug-like Pokémon. The majority of its body is red with a pale yellow streak down its front and a black cape-like marking on its back. Its head is encircled with a flat, pale yellow structure similar to a collar. A female has a bigger collar than a male. Two hard, black antennae with curled tips are connected to the head by a dark red segment. A similar dark red segment forms this Pokémon's nose, and it has small, black hands and feet. Kricketot are known to stumble sometimes due to their short legs. By shaking its head and rubbing its antennae together, Kricketot is able to create a sound similar to a xylophone or marimba that it uses to communicate with others of its kind. Kricketot are known to gather in greater numbers during autumn nights."
