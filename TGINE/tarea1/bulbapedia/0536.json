    "descripcion": "Palpitoad is an amphibious, bipedal Pok√©mon with an ovoid body. It is mostly blue, with a tan oval marking lined with black stretching from the bottom of its belly to its forehead. Its black eyes are round. Its upper lip is round as well and curves down sharply at the corners. Inside its mouth is a long, sticky tongue used to immobilize and capture prey. Its feet are small with three toes each, and its tail is oval and white. Three large half-spheres encircle its head, each one light blue with a black base. There are four round, light blue bumps starting on either side of its lower body and stretching across its back. The bumps on its head can be vibrated to create waves and earthquakes, as well as intense sounds to weaken its prey. The larger a Palpitoad's lumps are, the wider the range of sounds it can make."
