    "origin": "Based on its Pokémon Ruby Pokédex entry, Corphish may based on the red swamp crayfish (native to the southern and southeastern United States and also native to northern Mexico), which, like Corphish, are invasive pests in many countries. Corphish's ability to learn the move Dragon Dance may come from the literal meaning of the word \"lobster\" in Chinese, which is 龙虾 Lóngxiā (dragon shrimp).",
    "description": "Corphish is a red-shelled, crustacean Pokémon with a short tail similar to a lobster. Its eyes are saucer-like with small pupils, and it has three spikes on top of its head. It possesses four pairs of limbs in total: two large pincers used for gripping prey, and three pairs of legs used for walking. The upper segments of its legs, the underside of its body, and lower halves of its pincers are cream-colored. A hardy creature, Corphish is able to live in polluted water and eat nearly anything. Though not native to Alola, Corphish set free by Trainers there have easily adapted and thrived in the region. Feebas and Corphish are the only Pokémon known to be able to live in stagnant ditches. Corphish and its evolved form Crawdaunt are the only known Pokémon that do not flee when a swarm of Basculin appears in the lake it lives in."
