    "descripcion": "Miltank is a bipedal, bovine Pokémon, which can only be female. Its body is mostly pink, with a yellow belly and black, angular markings along its back. A black hood-like marking surrounds its face with a pink, triangular mark on its forehead. There are two small horns on top of its head. It has large, blue eyes, a black nose, and a wide mouth, as well as long, black, floppy ears with yellow insides. Miltank has a yellow udder with four pink teats. All four of its limbs end in black, cloven hooves, and its long tail is tipped with a black sphere. In The Young Flame Strikes Back!, a smaller Miltank was shown without any horns or teats, implying that this is what young Miltank look like. In every generation except for Generations VI and VII, Milk Drink is the signature move of Miltank. Prior to Generation VI, Miltank was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Milk Drink. The milk that it produces is sweet and very nutritious, and can be used to heal Pokémon and ill or weary humans. Drinking a large amount of Miltank's milk will cause the Pokémon or person to gain weight and develop stomach pains. The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season. It can produce over five gallons of milk per day, which in turn can be turned into yogurt or enjoyed unchanged by children and adults alike. Miltank can become ill if it is not milked every day. Miltank lives in grasslands, and is also raised on farms. Miltank has been supporting the lives of people and other Pokémon since ancient times with its ability to produce milk."
