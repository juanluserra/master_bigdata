    "description": "Charcadet is a humanoid Pok√©mon said to have been born from burnt charcoal. Its body is mostly black, except for its torso and extremities, which are red; and its head, which, apart from the face, is orange with red colorations on the top and back. The head is large and has a fire-like plume above it, tipped with pink and dark blue colors. Charcadet's forehead is covered with a black plate-like mask with three holes at the center, and its eyes have wisps emanating from its red-and-yellow pupils. Charcadet's head is connected to its body by a very tiny neck. Its torso resembles a tunic, with an orange protrusion at the front that seems to connect to its neck. Its hands and feet are cylindrical, and it has a fiery \"cape\" on its back. It has small, teardrop-shaped indents on its soles. Charcadet has a fiery fighting spirit, and will battle opponents tougher than itself. Its firepower increases as it fights, reaching temperatures of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius). It enjoys eating Berries that are rich in fat. As revealed in HZ057, Charcadet lived in Paldean lands since ancient times, forming bonds with humans. In the same episode, it is also said to have accompanied nobility and knights in the past. Charcadet's evolution is influenced by old sets of armor: one with auspicious wishes living within it and one with malicious will lurking within it."
