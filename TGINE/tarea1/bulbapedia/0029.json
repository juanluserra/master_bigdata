    "descripcion": "Nidoran♀ is a small, quadrupedal, mammalian Pokémon. It has large, spiny ears, oversized front teeth, red eyes, and whiskers on each cheek. It is light blue with several darker blue spots. There are two white claws on each of its paws. Its back is covered with small toxic spines, and it has a small forehead horn. The poisons secreted by the spines and horn are extremely potent, and even a scratch from its horn or a drop of poison from its barbs can be deadly. However, this docile Pokémon only uses its poison when it feels threatened. Nidoran♀ is more sensitive to smell than Nidoran♂. It can use its whiskers to check the wind while searching for berries or avoiding predators. Nidoran♀ can use its incisor teeth to crush the berries it forages for. Nidoran♀ lives in open spaces, such as savannas and plains. Nidoran♀ is a female-only species."
