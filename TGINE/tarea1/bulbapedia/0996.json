    "pokemon": "Frigibax",
    "pokedex_number": "0996",
    "origin": "Frigibax mostly resembles a baby dinosaur, perhaps specifically the Concavenator, a theropod dinosaur which had a crest on its back and quills on its forelimbs. Fossils of the genus were first discovered in Spain, and the crest is hypothesized to have functioned as a tool of thermoregulation. Frigibax may also draw inspiration from kaiju.",
    "description": "Frigibax is a stout, gray, bipedal reptilian Pokémon. Its head and facial features are large compared to the rest of its body, with eyes containing yellow sclerae and black pupils, a bulbous light gray snout with two nostrils, and a large mouth. On the left side below its lip is what appears to be a singular, square-shaped ice crystal. It has a light blue underbelly and a short tail. Its short, stubby limbs have three digits each, and it has a long, thin, yellow quill on the backs of each of its hands. As revealed HZ060 in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, Frigibax compare the sizes of their yellow quills to settle fights in the wild, with the one with the longest and more colorful quills winning. Frigibax has a triangular dorsal fin located atop a large, whitish circular pattern on its back. This fin absorbs heat, which Frigibax converts into ice energy. Frigibax stores the ice energy inside its body and uses it to cool its dwelling. It stores more ice energy the greater its surrounding temperatures are. Frigibax lives in forests and rough terrains, and fights with Bergmite whenever they meet. Frigibax and its evolutions are the only known Pokémon that can have Thermal Exchange as an Ability."
