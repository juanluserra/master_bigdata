    "descripcion": "Delcatty is a quadrupedal, feline Pokémon with a mostly tan body. It has a pointed, whisker-like protrusion on each cheek. Its purple ears have three tufts of fur at the tips, and there is a purple ruff-like collar with pin-like extensions around its neck. It has slim legs with tiny, digitless paws. It also possesses a purple, flower-like tuft of hair on the end of its thin tail. Delcatty is happy most of the time and rarely gets involved in conflicts. When it is disturbed, it just moves to another area instead of fighting. It prefers to do as it pleases at its own pace, so its daily routine is random. It is popular among female Trainers and used in competitions for its style and sublime fur. It is nocturnal and active at dusk. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Delcatty is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in tropical and temperate forests. It does not have a permanent nest and instead finds comfortable spots to sleep. Delcatty and its pre-evolved form, Skitty, are the only known Pokémon that can have Normalize as an Ability."
