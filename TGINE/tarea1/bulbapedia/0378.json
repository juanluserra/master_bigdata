    "descripcion": "Regice is a large, blue Pokémon composed of solid Antarctic ice. Its body is composed of angular crystal-like shapes and its face has an unusual pattern consisting of seven yellow dots in a \"+\" formation. It has four spikes on its back and its two legs are conical and it balances its entire body on their points. There are three fingers on each of its pentagonal arms. According to legend, Regice was created by the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas using ice. It used to be worshipped by humans, however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away. In Hoenn, it was sealed in the Island Cave; in Sinnoh, it was sealed in the Iceberg Ruins; and in Galar, it was sealed in the Iceberg Ruins. Regice moves around by floating in the air. Regice cloaks itself in air that is −328 °F (−200 °C), and anything near Regice will become frozen solid. Its deep-frozen body can't be melted, even surviving when submerged in molten lava. It is made of ice from the ice age. It is said that has slept in a glacier for thousands of years."
